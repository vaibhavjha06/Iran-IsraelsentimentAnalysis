Title: üß® Israel attacked because Iran was weeks away from having the bomb.
Content: 
I explain how a nuclear bomb is built, how uranium is enriched, why Iran was so close...
and why the world should thank Israel.

To make a nuclear bomb, highly enriched uranium is needed.

Natural uranium contains:
‚Ä¢99.27% ‚Äã‚ÄãU-238 (not suitable for bombs)
‚Ä¢0.72% of U-235 (the one that works)

For a bomb to work, that concentration of U-235 must be raised to 90% or more.
That's called weapons-grade.

How is this achieved? With centrifuges.

Uranium is converted into gas (uranium hexafluoride, UF ‚ÇÜ ).
This gas is spun in tubes at very high speed.

The lightest isotope (U-235) tends to concentrate in the center.
The heaviest one (U-238) moves away.
You separate, you repeat, and you enrich.

The more centrifuges you have (and the more advanced they are), the faster you can produce material for a bomb.

With 90% enriched uranium, you already have weapons-grade nuclear material.

With about 25 kg of U-235 you can make a bomb like the one in Hiroshima.

The design of that type of bomb (implosion or cannon) has been publicly available since 1945.

The difficult thing is not knowing how to do it.
The difficult part is getting the material.

Iran had already reached 60% enrichment.

That level is not suitable for civil nuclear energy.
It is only explained as an intermediate step to reach 90%.

Besides:
‚Ä¢It has thousands of IR-1 and IR-6 centrifuges.
‚Ä¢It has technical capacity, trained scientists, and uranium reserves.

According to the IAEA and Western intelligence sources, Iran was weeks away from obtaining the necessary material.

Why is this so serious?

An Iranian nuclear bomb:
‚Ä¢It would break the regional balance.
‚Ä¢It would start an arms race in the Middle East.
‚Ä¢It would represent a global threat if that knowledge or material falls into the hands of terrorist groups.

Israel cannot afford to wait for that to happen.

That is why Israel acted.

It was not an impulsive attack.
It was a surgical operation to prevent a fundamentalist regime from crossing the nuclear threshold.

He didn't do it just for Israel.
He did it for everyone.

This is not a theory. It is not an exaggeration.

It's nuclear physics.
It's geopolitics.
It's survival.

And it's all very simple:

üëâ The ayatollahs cannot be allowed to have an atomic bomb.

Title: Breaking: Israel strikes Iran
Content: Just seeing this story starting to break across various media platforms. No clear idea what's happening yet but it looks like limited precision strikes against IRGC commanders and possibly nuclear sites at this point. Strikes reported in Tehran.

Israeli government press release on "operation rising lion".

"Dozens of IAF jets completed the first stage that included strikes on dozens of military targets, including nuclear targets in different areas of Iran.

Today, Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the Iranian regime are an existential threat to the State of Israel and to the wider world.

The State of Israel has no choice but to fulfill the obligation to act in defense of its citizens and will continue to do so everywhere it is required to do so, as we have done in the past." (IDF)

Title: why are people happy Iran is bombing israel?
Content: i‚Äôd like to start off by saying that i‚Äôm asking this question in a ‚Äúplease educate me‚Äù type of way, and not in a rude way. the only reason I ask this is because people are upset that innocent children, women, and men were being bombed (palestinians), and now that Iran has started bombing israel, everyone‚Äôs happy about it. I understand fighting back, and defending yourself, but isn‚Äôt it the same concept that innocent children, women, and men are being bombed? I would genuinely just like to be educated on this cause it just confuses me a bit!!!

Title: Pro-Palestinian activists, why don't you support Israel's campaign in Iran?
Content: Iran having nuclear weapons isn't only bad for Israel. It would weaken the legitimate governments in Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Oman amongst others. Western ideals including democracy, equal rights for minorities, and freedom of speech and expression would be even further degraded in the Middle East across the board.

Not only that, but nuclear proliferation is good for nobody. Those who do currently have nuclear weapons will have less influence, sure, but it also increases the risk of nuclear war. Especially if a regime like that in Iran gets nuclear weapons. This regime is known to distribute weapons to their terror proxies like the Houthis. Once they have nuclear weapons, nothing stops them from doing this with nuclear warheads as well. Imagine the danger of random militia groups have nuclear weapons. Imagine what chaos they could start. 

Furthermore, if Israel is hit with a nuclear weapon, what do you think would happen to Palestinians? You think they wouldn't be impacted by the fallout of that? What about the contamination to their water and food supplies? The potential nuclear winter?

I will now repeat this sentence to fill out the arbitrary character count. I will now repeat this sentence to fill out the arbitrary character count. I will now repeat this sentence to fill out the arbitrary character count. I will now repeat this sentence to fill out the arbitrary character count.

Title: Why do leftist critics focus their moral appeals on Israel, but rarely expect responsibility from countries like Egypt or Iran?
Content: Let me start by saying: I strongly criticize Israel‚Äôs actions in Gaza. I believe the current Israeli government has a clear interest in weakening, if not demolishing, large parts of Gaza.

What I find puzzling is how left-wing critics often seem to frame Israel as the main or only actor responsible for fixing the situation ‚Äî expecting restraint, humanitarian aid, and political compromise. But that seems disconnected from reality: Israel‚Äôs leadership has no interest in helping Gaza and is clearly pursuing a hardline security agenda. That‚Äôs not hidden.

What‚Äôs often missing from this discourse is any demand for responsibility from other regional actors. Take Iran, for example: since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran has positioned itself as a major patron of the Palestinian cause, especially by funding and arming groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. Iran openly uses the Palestinian struggle as part of its geopolitical strategy against Israel and the West. Yet, when Palestinians suffer, we hear very little criticism or expectations directed toward Tehran.

Same with Egypt: it shares a border with Gaza, controls the Rafah crossing, and has historically played both mediator and gatekeeper. Still, it rarely gets the same moral scrutiny from Western leftists.

So my question is: Why is the moral and political pressure so heavily focused on Israel ‚Äî a country that clearly isn‚Äôt acting in good faith toward Gaza ‚Äî while neighboring powers who claim to support Palestine are rarely held to account or asked to help more directly?

I‚Äôm not defending Israel‚Äôs policies ‚Äî I‚Äôm just questioning the logic and consistency of the broader critique.

Title: Invading Iran for LOVE of Israel?
Content: I dislike iran specially their support for bashar but is it justified to go war for Israel out of Love for Israel?

Usa politicians says yes, nothing quite says national sovereignty like the USA warming up for yet another war, not for its own people, not for its own borders, but to satisfy the eternal cravings of a very special ally. Because when Israel so much as raises an eyebrow, suddenly there are Pentagon briefings, naval movements, and defense contractors polishing champagne glasses. Priorities.

Iran? The country hasn‚Äôt invaded anyone in decades. But it breathes wrong, and suddenly it‚Äôs time to send aircraft carriers halfway across the world. Not for American security, mind you‚Äîno one‚Äôs attacking Kansas but because Israel might feel uneasy. And if Israel‚Äôs uncomfortable, then clearly it's America's job to start lighting things on fire.

Funny how the USA can‚Äôt fix its healthcare system or pass basic infrastructure without a congressional meltdown, but if Tel Aviv gets nervous, suddenly there‚Äôs bipartisan agreement, blank checks, and 24/7 cable

 news hysteria. It‚Äôs amazing what can be done when someone else‚Äôs national interests are on the line.

And of course, any skepticism is met with the usual chorus ‚Äúsupport our allies,‚Äù ‚Äúdefend democracy,‚Äù ‚Äúnational security.‚Äù As if launching missiles into sovereign nations is just the geopolitical equivalent of sending a Hallmark card. Nothing quite like sacrificing lives, stability, and trillions of dollars to keep another country feeling warm and cozy.

But hey, who needs peace or diplomacy when there‚Äôs a chance to prove eternal loyalty? If American soldiers have to die to make Israel feel a little more secure, well, that‚Äôs just the price of love. Right?

At this point, the Stars and Stripes might as well come with a little blue and white tag: Made in Washington, Powered by Tel Aviv

But I don't think so
What do you think?

Title: Is there any reason why Israel hasn't gone all in on Iran already?
Content: Seriously, why are people protecting an oppresive country that's been throwing rockets at Israel for the past decades, and wishes death upon the Israeli on every conference/talk they make, wishes death to western civilized countries with nukes that thank god were disabled for now, a country that has fueled the middle east with terrorism for many years and has only destabilized the region,, and a country that oppreses their people to the full extent.

Is Israel afraid of the public shaming and that's why they're not attacking it with all of their power, but rather doing small attacks?

I don't want to see civilians die, fuck missiles, but the world would be better off if it decided to send a huge number of their infantry and take down their regime.

Title: Israel‚Äôs Nuclear Program compared to Iran‚Äôs
Content: So I‚Äôll start with my usual introduction - in the past, I was strongly inclined to be pro-Israel.  I would always try to argue Israel‚Äôs case to people who were critical of it.  If I‚Äôm honest, I became quite closed-minded about it so I‚Äôm trying to learn a bit more about it.

The understanding I have is that most people believe that Israel does have nuclear weapons but have not officially confirmed or denied this.  The most concrete evidence (available to the general public) of Israel‚Äôs nuclear weapons comes from a former technician at the nuclear site who leaked information to a British newspaper in the mid 80s.  

The history seems to be that Israel developed its weapons secretly.  President Kennedy was in favour of inspections of Israel‚Äôs nuclear site but Israelis were uncooperative.  Golda Meir later reached an agreement with Nixon that the US would tolerate Israel‚Äôs secrecy about its nuclear program as long as it was not tested or publically declared.  Israel has not signed the treaty of non-proliferation.

What do Israel‚Äôs supporters say in response to the argument that Israel‚Äôs secrecy about nuclear weapons create a double standard that undermines international efforts to police Iran‚Äôs nuclear technology?

Furthermore, it could be argued that Iran has good reason to want to develop nuclear weapons - for example, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iran in their war in the 1980s.  America continued to support Iraq throughout this war and opposed UN motions that condemned Iraq.

So how can the double standard be justified by Israel‚Äôs supporters?  Israel‚Äôs small size means that it needs them for security when it is surrounded by far larger enemies with far larger populations?  Iran‚Äôs support for terrorist groups means that it having nuclear weapons would be a far greater security risk?  

I‚Äôm interested in hearing people‚Äôs takes on this.  It feels like the world is on the brink of WW3.  Unless someone is committed to bombing anything that Iran ever builds that appears to be even slightly nuclear and then dealing with Iran‚Äôs response to them doing this then in the long run, surely there‚Äôs nothing that can be done to or prevent them from obtaining nuclear weapons eventually if they are determined to do so.  Regime change isn‚Äôt guaranteed and external efforts to impose regime change are likely to backfire or send the country into chaos.  Even if the regime did change, there‚Äôs no guarantee that the new regime would forever be friendly towards Israel or would never try to develop nuclear weapons.

I increasingly feel that Israel relies on double standards that undermine the very idea of international law and order.  

I know it‚Äôs a bit of a tangent from the rest of my post but consider the West Bank settlements - regarded as illegal by the international community and international legal bodies.  

I get why Israel disputes this (eg. there never was a Palestinian state to have occupied the land from), although I can‚Äôt say I agree with them - but surely Israel could, at the very least stop expanding the settlements.  

Surely the existence of Israel within its recognised borders is something for them to be grateful for.  Why it is worth trying to claim more land if it increases the risk of that country being internationally isolated or one day destroyed?  I‚Äôm not suggesting that they should immediately give the land over to a future Palestinian state even if it would create borders that were a massive security risk.  Why not just refrain from building settlements on it until some agreement has been reached - indefinitely if needed - if only to maintain greater legitimacy when arguing that the borders need to be changed for security reasons.

Title: Iran isn‚Äôt just Israel problem, and it‚Äôs infuriating that the rest of the world doesn‚Äôt take action against them
Content: I don‚Äôt know how much Reddit represents the world public opinion but every time I see posts about Trump considering joining the war the majority of comments says: ‚ÄúUS shouldn‚Äôt get involved, that it‚Äôs not their war, it‚Äôs Israel problem, Israel attacked first and try to drag us into it‚Äù

Iran is a problem that the US created, they led into regime change that exploded in their face, they wanted to buy oil from them, the west funded them by buying their oil for years.

The world wanted to turn a blind eye so gas prices will stay low. The west signed a nuclear agreements with them that had a very clear warning to what will happen if they break it. The US and Trump kept warning them from trying to get nukes, yet they speedrun into it and then Israel is left alone to fight against them, some countries like Japan even has the audacity to criticize Israel for striking there. Irony speaks for itself when the only country that experienced the harm of nuclear weapons go and defend a terrorist country to have it, everything for the greed of cheap oil, even if the next generations will be doomed by it.

The UN showed proofs that they are lying, Israel revealed they were days from having a bomb all the while they stalled time with Trump about a new deal.

And even now Trump keeps talking about a deal. What deal? They just lied to him for months.

And why the rest of the world act as if only Israel cares if they get nuclear weapons? It will change the entire middle east and the entire world, Israel is not their only enemy, they‚Äôre the enemy of most of the modern world.

Israel so far has defeated their military, but hasn‚Äôt been able to destroy all their nuclear facilities, for that the rest of the world, mainly the US should get involved, as only they have the weapons with the capabilities. But Trump only cares about PR, I find it hard to believe the US intelligence didn‚Äôt know about their lies, but he still chooses to believe they respect him and sign a deal that they‚Äôll keep.

Title: The fact that Iran is developing nuclear weapons is a good reason why Israel should attack it?
Content: Let‚Äôs suppose another scenario. Let‚Äôs take a country with nuclear bombs in its arsenal, let‚Äôs say France, though I‚Äôm not sure. At this time, it has a government of the center-right. But let‚Äôs take this one step further and assume France is governed by the center-left. Let‚Äôs suppose also that when the next elections come, a far-right government emerges. Its president also starts to enact laws against international law. Do the nations inside NATO have the right to attack France and its nuclear plants because it‚Äôs a far-right government that, though it hasn‚Äôt started another October 7, plans, according to intelligence reports, to increase the expense of nuclear weapons (and not just them)?

TL;DR: The reasoning described in the post, according to me, applies both to Iran and to any far-right government. I also believe that the answer to the question in the title is ‚Äúno.‚Äù A country developing nuclear weapons works as a deterrent against foreign invaders. Also, to avoid starting WWIII.

In any case, I believe that it‚Äôs a move the USA approves because they leave Israel to do their dirty work to eliminate oppressors, mass murderers, and the like. Which the USA cannot do because its position as a West democracy would collapse overnight if it was discovered they did so.

Title: How does Israel-Iran war ends without regime change?
Content: Israel stated regime change is not the goal https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-official-overthrowing-irans-regime-not-goal-of-strikes-but-all-options-on-table-if-they-cross-red-lines/

However, this is the six day(2 week) war. How does Israel prevent the yom Kippur war which will definitely occur if Iranian regime doesn't fall and is allowed to rearm? Is Israel willing to leave on its toes forever? I see no way out of this without 

1. Complete destruction of Iran.
2. Iran getting a nuke. 
Iran cannot destroy Israel because Israel has nukes. 

There is nothing in between that I see.

Title: The Iran attack on Israel is going to hurt the Palestinians 
Content: This hour is a reminder that Iran, one of the most evil regimes in the world, is allied with the Palestinians. People who viewed them separately will no longer be able to. The western world, which feels threatened by Iran, will not be able to separate the two. 

I am curious as to how Palestinian propaganda is going to spin this. Are they going to publicly support Iran? Or are they going to try to distance themselves from it? My guess is the former, as they do publicly support Hezbollah and the Houthis. 

Any westerner who doesn‚Äôt understand this conflict will know where their countries‚Äô stand soon enough. 

Edit:

We know now. Palestinians are defending Iran and believe Israel provoked them in the first place. If a world war begins, pro palestinians in western countries will be classified as insurgents. 

Edit 2:

Iran‚Äôs attack was a joke.

Title: Calmly explain the mental gymnastics req‚Äôd to navigate Iran > Hamas > Invade Israel > ‚Äòüáµüá∏ Genocide‚Äô?
Content: Set aside the spectacle, slogans, & sensationalism.  The current crisis in the Middle East is tragic & pulls at the heart strings of our very humanity.  In the ‚ÄòWest,‚Äô decades of identity politics, dumbing down the public, and a generation of people who are willfully ignorant have all contributed to a general public detached from reality, affixed to their phones, and all-too-ready to express outrage over anything & everything.  

Against that backdrop, we have an Iranian-funded proxy militia who invaded another sovereign country & started a war. For clarity, it‚Äôs worth noting that Iran‚Äôs goal is, ‚Äúdeath to Israel,‚Äù and ‚Äúdeath to America.‚Äù 
**Genocide** - *the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group* (src: Oxford Dictionary). 

‚ÄúDeath to Israel,‚Äù ‚ÄúFrom the River to the Sea,‚Äù - these are rallying cries for *genocide*.  They‚Äôve  repeatedly demonized the Jews. Example are too numerous to list, here are a few:
1. President Ahmadinejad‚Äôs threats to ‚Äúwipe Israel off the map,‚Äù prompted letters to the UN Security Council, US Sec of State & Int‚Äôl Criminal Court, re:  violation of Convention on **Genocide**.
2. Supreme Leader Khamenei - at ‚ÄúJerusalem Day‚Äù gathering 2012, called for unity ‚Äúto remove the Zionist black stain from human society.‚Äù - **Genocide**
3. Prior to that, Khamenei took inspiration from Hitler, stating there is ‚Äújustification to kill all the Jews and annihilate Israel, and Iran must take the helm." - Direct quote, inciting **Genocide**
4. Mid-2010‚Äôs, senior Iranian officials classified Jews as nonhuman/ subhuman: "bloodthirsty barbarians," "filthy bacteria," "wild beasts," "cattle," "cancer," "filthiest criminals," "a blot," "a stain," "wild dogs" - Direct quotes - **racist**, **xenophobic**, **dehumanizing**
5. Pezeshkian, 2024, inaugurated with chants of ‚ÄúDeath to Israel‚Äù & ‚ÄúDeath to America‚Äù (src: Reuters) - **Genocide**

With a well established agenda of destroying Israel, destroying America, and eradicating the Jews - **Genocide** - Iran is too weak & disliked by their own regional neighbors to take direct action, they can‚Äôt survive the reprisal. So they fund regional militia groups that allow them to pursue their goals of **Genocide**, in particular:
1. Hamas (Palestine)
2. Islamic Jihad (Palestine)
3. Hezbollah (Lebanon)
4. Houthis (Yemen)
5. Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq (Iraq)
6. Kata'ib Hezbollah (Iraq)
7. Harakat al-Nujaba (Syria/ Iraq)

Iran has their Al-Quds branch coordinating the militias and reporting/taking direct orders from Khamenei. All of this is a campaign to carry out their goal of **Genocide**, while insulating Iranian territory from the conventional cost of blood at the expense of other countries‚Äô citizens, to whom they claim to be allies.  One terrorist state running multiple foreign terrorist regimes. 

Palestinians have demonstrated solidarity with Hamas, allowing Hamas to effectively rule them & do whatever they decide to. In March, support for Hamas among Palestinians had *grown*. In June, Palestinian support for Hamas had increased even further. (Src: Ramallah-based non-profit Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research). 

According to the Palestinian polls in June, ‚Äú*only seven percent of Gazans blamed Hamas for their suffering. Seventy-one percent of all Palestinians supported Hamas‚Äôs decision to attack Israel on October 7 ‚Äî up 14 points among Gazans and down 11 points among West Bank Palestinians compared to three months ago. Fifty-nine percent of all Palestinians thought Hamas should rule Gaza, and 70 percent were satisfied with the role Hamas has played during the war.*‚Äù

That‚Äôs reality. Millions of displaced people who were in support of Hamas, a terrorist organization funded by **Genocidal** Iran, coordinated by terrorists in IRGC & run by Al-Quds specialists under the direct blessing of Khamenei, have galvanized every day since the Oct 7, 2023 massacre inside Israel.  Hamas has approx. 40,000 fighters. Palestine has a population of over 5.5 million (src: World Population Review; and, U.N.).  Gaza has a population of approx. 2.23 million, the West Bank has approx. 3.2 million. 

If 5.5 Million people are content to be ruled by 40,000 terrorists, celebrate their acts of violence, yet deny any personal responsibility, align themselves with the world‚Äôs epicenter of hate, in service of their **Genocidal** agenda, and that terrorist regime starts a war by invading a sovereign country, killing thousands, raping men, women & children __*on video*__, what right does that group have to claim anyone aside from themselves is attempting **Genocide**?  And how is it that anyone, much less homosexual white people from America & Western Countries, can call any targeted form of conventional retaliation, ‚Äò*Genocide*‚Äô with a straight face? 

I‚Äôm sorry but did starting a war become *inconvenient*?  Not inconvenient enough to do anything about their leadership, regime, allies, plan forward. Just enough to pretend a few thousand deaths, while horrible, are somehow **Genocide** the likes of which exceed the *proven* Holocaust that they so ardently deny? 

Relative to their population, Israel endured 20x 9/11‚Äôs simultaneously - if the 9/11 victims had all been raped & tortured on video before being marched into the Twin Towers for execution.  So my questions for anyone who‚Äôs studied world history is at what point does a people need to be accountable for the way in which they‚Äôve decided to live? At what point are a people who have, even after an atrocity, expressed support for their leaders part of the terror machine?  At what point is a civil war better than a world war?  How does it fall upon the countries who are being targeted & victimized by Iran, Hamas & their so-called ‚ÄúAxis of Resistance‚Äù to supply humanitarian aid, prolonging the suffering & dragging out the eventual outcome?  Why is there a moral equivocation between terrorists invading another country, raping & killing for sport, destroying all they can, then crying about the *consequences*?  Gays got rights in America within the last 20 years‚Ä¶ maybe some of the LGTBQ-aggrieved should go to Gaza and protest in solidarity, see how well that works out? 

If a Nazi didn‚Äôt personally run a gas chamber, but loaded the Gypsys, Jews, Handicapped & Homosexuals onto the trains, are they exculpated from their role in the ensuing torture & death machines?  Should the allies have celebrated the virtuous Nazi‚Äôs who did everything but open the Zyklon B or operate an oven? 

Palestinians invaded another country, raped, murdered en mass, and memorialized the moment on film.  Palestinians continue to support the regime that did this. Palestinians continue to provide the perpetrators safe harbor. Palestinians, and Iranians, *planned* on exploiting Western liberals - the same people that they‚Äôd kill in an instant, if given the chance.  The strategy behind this attack *was the ensuing international dissent* that has emerged in the aftermath. 

The vast majority of the human race believes it‚Äôs unacceptable to do what Hamas did, but politically the first concern is patronizing the vocal minority who have no skin in the game or who have direct connections to the perpetrators, all of which have now recast themselves as the ‚Äòvictims‚Äô - of their own actions. 

Most of all, can someone explain how *conventional* retaliation from a terrorized country toward their invaders qualifies as *Genocide*?   Call it war. Call it a humanitarian crises.  I‚Äôve not heard one voice call for the extinction of the Muslim peoples calling for the extinction of the Jews.  Liberals won‚Äôt like this, but sometimes you reap what you sow in this life.  I don‚Äôt say this in a heartless manner, or in giving Israel a ‚Äúfree-pass.‚Äù  However, America lecturing anyone on how to respond to anything militarily is, in itself, a sad satirical irony.  If I‚Äôm middle class, but I identify as a billionaire, should AmEx issue me a Black Card?  It‚Äôs clear as day we‚Äôre headed for a catastrophe, because people who have lived through or witnessed a ‚Äògenocide,‚Äô they don‚Äôt use the word so lightly.  Now that we‚Äôre out of WW2 survivors, seems history is destined to repeat itself.  

So please, explain to me how terrorists in Iran openly promulgating **Genocide** against the Jews & Americans for decades have somehow orchestrated the ‚Äòactual‚Äô **Genocide** of their own militants at the hands of their preferred victims? 
While you‚Äôre at it, please explain why Western tax dollars are flying out the treasury doors to provide food/water/medicine for the displaced, and in turn the displaced are using the charity not to chart a different course but instead to *increase* their support for Hamas, spending borrowed time like it‚Äôs counterfeit at the expense of our economic & civil unrest.  

Parting thought: If those who start wars are permitted to endure war, doesn‚Äôt that establish the boundaries of acceptable behavior in a global order?  Should we keep treating the most sinister offenders to a reprieve on the consequences until things literally go nuclear?  Why haven‚Äôt i heard anyone exhorting Palestinians to get Palestine, their home, under control?  This entire conflict was engineered to be nothing more than a horrifying outburst giving way to the manipulation of common sense which would divide & castrate the international community.  

Thank you.

Title: Study finds that Israel targeted on Twitter more than any country. More than Iran, China, N Korea.
Content: According to a new study, Israel was mentioned more than any other country including China, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Russia, Myanmar and Yemen in tweets regarding human rights violations.

&#x200B;

[The study found that "Israel was mentioned approximately 10 times more than any other country in tweets pertaining to human rights violations." This disturbing trend reveals a deep-seated double standard against the country, perpetuating a disproportionate focus in social media discussions.](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-749794)

&#x200B;

Anti-Zionism is Anti-Semitism. It is not a fight for "human rights." There are at least 20+ countries in the world actually committing gross human rights violations but they are not the focus of attention. There are no groups calling for these states to be dismantled - only Israel. Groups like Amnesty and UN unfairly bash Israel disproportionately more than any other country, while ignoring the world's greatest human rights violators.

&#x200B;

I do not believe this is necessarily a bad thing. Opposition breeds strength of spirit and character. It is my belief that a large portion of our survival and success across 4,000 years is our ability to overcome this primal hatred. Unfortunately, we are accustomed to centuries of Anti-Semitism. We can stick up for ourselves.

Title: Breaking: Israel Strikes IRGC Targets in Iran in Response to Ballistic Missile Attack Earlier This Month
Content: Israel has begun its long anticipated retaliatory attack on IRGC targets in Iran after some 200 ballistic missiles were launched at Israel on October 1st.

IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari has released the following [statement](https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1849957541301666038) on the attacks:

>In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel‚Äîright now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran.   
The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7th‚Äîon seven fronts‚Äîincluding direct attacks from Iranian soil.   
Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond.  
Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized.   
We will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel.

While specific targets have not yet been verified, footage has begun appearing on social media showing numerous air strikes in Tehran.

I will be updating this thread with footage and more information sometime after the initial fog of war clears.

2. Should Israel wait until after the US Presidential election to hit Iran ? If Trump gets into the White House, there is a chance Israel could get the green light from Washington to hit Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities. 

EDIT: 
After more thoughts, even ‚Äúif‚Äù Israel wants to wait until after the US election, I think Biden cannot afford to wait. What kind of message will that send ? Biden is weak ? There are no consequences to Iran hitting Israel, a US ally, even after Biden repeatedly warned Iran not to ? What will other US allies think ? Trump is going to go all out regardless true or false‚Ä¶Biden / Harris are weak, they are preventing Israel from retaliating, ‚Ä¶.the very same analyst that Iran took almost two months to retaliate after the assisination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehren, many people thought Iran was weak, could not and did not dare attack Israel, but it did on Oct 1st. What will US voters think of a weak or delayed response ? So I now think Biden will allow Israel to retaliate soon, with some assistance from US, Biden needs to make sure that response is not too weak, but also not too escalatory (a measured, proportionate response).

Title: Some people might not understand why Jordan helped Israel intercept Iran‚Äôs missiles.
Content: While it‚Äôs true that Jordan and Israel have fought fierce wars in the past, things changed after Palestinians assassinated Jordan's King Abdullah and attempted to assassinate another king, Hussein. Since then, the Jordanian royal family may have developed an even deeper resentment toward the Palestinians‚Äînot only expelling them from Jordan but also strictly controlling its borders to prevent their entry, and eventually reaching a reconciliation with Israel.

Egypt is also highly wary of the Palestinians in Gaza. Along the Gaza border, Egypt has built at least four major barriers: an early steel wall, a cleared buffer zone, a concrete wall, and a wide-area defense wall and fence system. In addition, Egypt has pumped poison gas and seawater into tunnels, creating multiple layers of "security barriers."

As for Iran, there is a sharp divide between its government and its people. From what I understand, Iran is perhaps the most anti-Islamic Islamic country. In 2022, Iranian women launched a movement against the hijab, and even many men joined in to support women‚Äôs right not to wear it. Many Iranians long for the secular Pahlavi monarchy and wish someone would bring an end to the current regime, which enforces Islamic law and arrests women for not wearing a headscarf. So, some Iranians might actually celebrate if Israel were to attack Iran.

Title: If you are the final voice in the situation room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran?
Content: The question in the title was asked in the US vice presidential debate last night, and I wanted to open it up to see what people here thought (both candidates kind of [dodged the question](https://reason.com/2024/10/01/walz-and-vance-dodge-the-question-on-bombing-iran/)).

Reports are saying that[ 180 ballistic missiles](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-822801) were fired into Israel yesterday, leading to everyone in Israel to take shelter. Iran previously attacked with [170 drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles in April. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1c4q0zy/implications_of_the_iran_attack/)You can read more details about the attack at the [Institute of the Study of War](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024), and this current attack is claimed to be in response to killing Nasrallah and Haniyeh.

Here's my thinking:

Iran is a nuclear threshold country, and letting Iran attack like this is unsustainable. Just like the calculus towards deterring Hamas and Hezbollah has changed, the calculus towards the IRGC should change as well.

However, Israel should be careful to not spread its forces too thin. They have now opened another theater in Southern Lebanon, and I assume they are wrapping things up in Gaza. If Israel decides to create another theater in Iran, than it could also have adverse economic implications for Israel when they have to prolong their war economy.

[ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1c4q0zy/implications_of_the_iran_attack/)Capability wise, Israel would come out on top. In addition to Haniyeh, groups like [Predatory Sparrow have successfully initiated massive cyberattacks](https://www.wired.com/story/predatory-sparrow-cyberattack-timeline/) against Iran. Moreover, we are seeing that Iran's rockets are closer in technological capacity to Hamas and Hezbollah weapons - they explode in mid-air without anti-ballistics, and they are hardly precise. Iranian rockets are simply fired in the direction of Israel in the hope that they will hit something.

Just like Hezbollah, I'm sure that there is more propaganda surrounding Iran that makes them out to be "turban Napoleons" more than they are. Iran has not really demonstrated that they are being careful in calculating their tactical decisions, they seem to be operating more in damage control mode to make up for their intelligence failures.

Edit: Several users have pointed out that preemptive would mean that Israel would have struck before Iran launched their ballistic missiles. These users are right. 

The original debate question was in the context of asking American political candidates what their stance is on Israel's next steps. Israel was just attacked by Iran again. How should Israel respond, and would you support or oppose an attack on Iran given the current situation?

Title: I would like some quotes and actions / events that support Iran has intent to destroy Israel and Israeli actions are preemptive and necessary.
Content: So I tried to scour the internet for some information about Israel‚Äôs fears of Iranian nuclear power. What I got instead was dozens of articles about Israeli genocide on Palestinians. Not kidding. 

This has become so common and so frustrating to me. It is one of the major reasons why i continue to access ChatGPT ( even though it‚Äôs not reliable to the point of inaccurate on hot/political topics unless you already have a knowledge base on whatever topic it is.) 

So.. I wanted to start a thread about evidence of the Iranian government‚Äôs violent intent towards Israel.

I was completely against the nuclear program to begin with and had a slight fit about it at the time. It was less about Israel and more about arming a militant Islamic republic. Which probably isn‚Äôt a good idea at any time. We would never give Afganistan or Yemen or Somalia nuclear power for the same reasons. You just can‚Äôt trust it at the end of the day. 

I feel that the Iranian people are largely / mostly against their government and I feel like they are victims of this regime also. Almost every single Iranian person I have ever met hates what has happened to their country and is squarely against what is happening there. They tend to support Israel in the fight against Hamas even. (I have been following what‚Äôs going on in Iran for a while related to lack of women‚Äôs rights and their human rights violations.) 

I think the world is deprived of any information that would support Israel in this - and I admit - bombing a country isn‚Äôt a great look. As a progressive left etc, I don‚Äôt listen to any news that would support this move. So for me and my political party, we are deprived of information that supports Israeli actions. 

I have learned so much about this particular conflict that I trust in Israel‚Äôs decisions. 

I think I‚Äôve come to believe that Zionism is absolutely necessary for Jewish survival. 

I also believe that the Jews have every right to their ancestral homeland and religious sites. Period. Far more than anyone else on the planet has. Just to clarify. 

If anyone can provide some history and quotes, 
It would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

Title: Is Israel even going to attack Iran? Will it even be significant?
Content: I've been hearing about this so-called "imminent and severe" attack for the better part of a month now, and absolutely nothing has happened.

Is this all just political posturing? How can this possibly be imminent?

And even if something minor happens now, the fact that Israel waited almost a month to respond with something minor doesn't exactly convey the message they claim to be sending to Iran. 

What are your thoughts?

Title: Are we on the threshold of an Iran-Israel war?
Content: For those that didn't see it:

[US official says Iran preparing to 'imminently' attack Israel with ballistic missiles | The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/us-official-says-iran-preparing-to-imminently-attack-israel-with-ballistic-missiles/)

*Iran is planning to attack Israel ‚Äúimminently‚Äù with ballistic missiles, an anonymous senior White House official tells Israeli and US media.*

*The official says that ‚Äúwe are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack. A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran.‚Äù*

Then carried afterwards by the BBC, Al Jazeera, everywhere...

Looks as if Iran may now intervene directly in the face of the assumption, they would do nothing. Apparently maybe they actually do have "red lines". And perhaps after Nasrallah, in the face of becoming the laughing  stock of the Arab world in the face of claiming to be the big force of resistance against the "Zionist entity/regime".

Question is whether this looks serious this time, or whether its a comparative slap on the wrist strikes earlier this year. Israel will strike back for sure, and then there's the question of what the US forces in the region do.

Meanwhile in Lebanon, the IDF apparently has announced any incursion will be limited and short, lasting days, not weeks. This morning was a joke with headlines claiming an invasion of Lebanon that never was... And apparently that isn't the news of the day....

Imminent apparently, with BBC turning its footage to Tel Aviv, as if everyone is waiting for something big to happen.

Is this the big moment where this set of proxy wars turns into a hot region-wide war? Which countries and sides get involved?

Is this the moment where the Iran nuclear crisis gets resolved?

The world holds its breath.

Title: Are you concerned that Israel might nuke Iran to drag the U.S. into a war?
Content: 
I'm increasingly concerned about the geopolitical maneuvers involving Netanyahu and Trump. It seems Netanyahu is desperate to help Trump win reelection, particularly as he perceives Harris as an unreliable ally, despite her history of supporting Israel. The problem for Netanyahu is Iran and Hezbollah have been quite restrained. So I‚Äôm concerned that he might resort to dangerous measures. There‚Äôs a troubling possibility that Netanyahu might stage an attack‚Äîperhaps even using a nuclear weapon to strike a deserted area in Iran. If he were to do this, he could falsely claim that Iran tested a nuclear weapon, positioning it as a justification for military action against them.

Such a scenario would not only paint Iran as a nuclear threat but could also provoke a significant U.S. response, dragging the country into another war in the Middle East. Netanyahu might then attempt to shift blame onto Harris, leveraging public sentiment to rally support for Trump, which could bolster Trump's chances in the election. In return, Trump might feel pressured to allow further Israeli territorial expansion, such as the annexation of the West Bank, solidifying Netanyahu‚Äôs position and agenda.


Netanyahu is also facing his own legal troubles and is motivated to eliminate the Iranian regime, which he views as a direct threat to Israel's security. These motivations create a dangerous cocktail of political maneuvering, where national and international stability could be sacrificed for personal and political gain. Overall his goal is to keep the U.S. in the Middle East and to remain in power.

Netanyahu sabatoged the Oslo accords, in the 90s. Even out of power he continued to have a lot of influence. 
He‚Äôs been in power long enough.

What‚Äôs your take?

Title: How The Israel-Iran War Will End
Content: Iran has responded with massive missile and drone strikes to Israel's preemptive airstrike on nuclear facilities and military targets on Friday, June 13, 2025, supported by smaller-scale operations inside Iran by the Mossad. Israel's initial strike caused severe damage to the Natanz and Isfahan nuclear facilities and crippled numerous defense systems and ballistic missile production facilities.

Israel's stated goals are, first, to destroy Iran's nuclear weapons program and, second, to stop the country's missile program. An unofficial indirect goal, I assume, is to change Iran's theocratic regime.

There are no signs yet of regime change in Iran, although on the other hand, there have been demonstrations in Iran and abroad supporting Israel's strikes. Inside Iran, the current government is based on the religious population of the countryside and the Revolutionary Guard. The civilized, secular, young population of the cities is too powerless to make a change; the situation may change in the future if Iran's ethnic groups on the periphery - such as the Kurds - begin to demand greater autonomy after the Revolutionary Guard's power has been sufficiently weakened.

Attacks on Israel's home front reinforce the urgency of Israel's campaign to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. Any of the hundreds of ballistic missiles launched at Israel could have been equipped with nuclear warheads if Iran had been allowed to achieve its goal.

As things stand, Israel will not achieve its first goal. Although several nuclear facilities \[Natanz and Parchin being the most important\] have already been largely destroyed, the most significant of them, the Fordow facility, located about 80 meters below sea level, has not yet been significantly damaged.

The second goal seems to be being met. Iran still possesses thousands of ballistic and cruise missiles, so at the current intensity of the war it can carry out attacks on Israel for a couple of weeks, while Israel can do this for even longer with its air superiority and capacity. It is also possible that Iran will quickly manufacture a so-called dirty bomb from the radioactive material it possesses, which could be used by cells operating in the West.

Against the background presented above, I see three alternative scenarios for the end of the war:

1) Israel destroys Iran's nuclear weapons program using its tactical nuclear weapons,

2) The US destroys Iran's nuclear weapons program using or lending its strategic bombers capable of carrying the heaviest bunker busters with which, for example, the Fordow facility, which is almost a hundred meters underground, can be destroyed.

3) Iran is ready to give up its nuclear weapons program in the nuclear negotiations and guarantee international inspectors full and free access to its country to verify the promised abandonment.

My own assessment is that the US will use any aid it may give to Israel as leverage to persuade Iran to sign an agreement to ensure the destruction of its nuclear weapons program.

Title: I fear that Iran's attack on Israel will be very harmful for Muslims and Pro-Palestinian supporters
Content: Until this week, the Isreal-Palestine conflict and the current war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas has been pretty focused with the proxy war between Iran and Israel slowly chugging in the background. Weekly protests in major western cities across the world have advocated support to either the Palestinian or Israeli side with the Palestinian side appearing to be winning the PR battle.

That is until Iran's firing of hundreds of missiles and drones from it's own borders and those of other countries including Iraq, Syria, and Yemen as a response to Israel's attack on the Iranian embassy complex in Syria where multiple IRGC officials, PIJ, Hezbollah and other members were killed. Iranian news sources also stated this month that the IRGC general was involved in the planning and execution of of Al Aqsa Storm on oct 7th.

While the protests before were focused on a ceasefire in Gaza, you had those same protesters and groups now cheering on Iran and the IRGC in Toronto, Chicago, and other cities in Western countries. This was followed by an organized protest to block bridges and cause economic harm this week.

I fear that this direct association with the protesters supporting Iran and organized protests with the goal of causing economic damage will be viewed akin to terrorism. Governments will ramp up their intelligence services to watch those abroad and these protests will lose legitimacy and support by the general public.

This lessened support will mean that the following mass surveillance will be something that opposing parties of western governments can all agree on and many people will have their lives ruined for being involved and exercising their right to free speech.

I am not here to argue about the general premise or legitimacy of both the pro-palestine and pro-israel camps. I am worried about how governments will see this as direct support to terrorism and people involved in these protest groups (whether informed or misinformed) will have their lives ruined for (legitimate or Illegitimate reasons).

Each camp believes their cause is just. Each camp also has righteous reasons, legitimate grievances, radical groups, state and third party backed propaganda machines, majority Muslim support for the pro-palestine and Jewish support for Pro-Israel and minority support against for each camp. I simply fear that western countries will use this as justification to crack down for the direct support of Iran and would be justified in doing so. This will lead to anti-muslim sentiment in the west and increase global tensions.

I cannot predict what the long term outcome will be, but this conflict will continue to hear up and countries across the world will be forced to pick sides sooner rather than later. Lines will be drawn as soon as this happens and the new association of axis and allied powers will shake up and shift the global economy from where it is now in unpredictable and terrible ways.

Title: Israel‚Äôs Proxy War Headache: How Iran Keeps Handing Out Rockets Like Free Samples
Content: You ever have that one neighbor who doesn't do anything themselves but somehow always causes trouble? Yeah, that‚Äôs Iran in the Middle East right now. Instead of going toe-to-toe with Israel directly, Iran is the guy that hands out baseball bats to everyone on the block and tells them to go break windows for him. It's like the ultimate game of "not my problem" ‚Äì except with rockets, drones, and proxy armies. Lucky Israel, right?

So let‚Äôs break down Iran‚Äôs game plan, or what I like to call their **"Here, You Fight Israel for Me" Strategy**:

**Step 1: Find a Proxy**  
Iran doesn‚Äôt exactly like getting its hands dirty. Instead of jumping into the ring, they play the puppet master, arming and funding various groups that, for lack of a better phrase, *really* hate Israel. First, it was **Hamas**, then **Hezbollah**, and now we‚Äôve got the **Houthis** down in Yemen making some noise. It's like they have their own Grim Reaper making house calls on behalf of Tehran (seriously, see my meme below).

These proxies don‚Äôt just have slingshots and angry slogans either. Thanks to Iran, they're packing drones, missiles, and rockets like they're on some Middle Eastern version of *America's Got (Explosive) Talent*. And who are they performing for? Yep, Israel.

**Step 2: The Rocket Roulette**  
So what does Israel get in return? A never-ending game of **Rocket Roulette**, where every few months (or days, depending on the season), a different proxy decides to launch a barrage at Israeli cities. Israel has to be ready to dodge, block, and retaliate. Meanwhile, Iran sits back like, ‚ÄúHey, I didn‚Äôt do it!‚Äù

Just picture it: The Iron Dome is like Israel's umbrella in a never-ending storm of rockets, and it's raining‚Äî**a lot**. Sometimes it‚Äôs Hamas from Gaza with their home-brewed rockets; other times it‚Äôs Hezbollah, sneaking missiles out of southern Lebanon like they‚Äôre delivering pizzas. And now the Houthis have joined the party by tossing drones and missiles from Yemen. Everyone wants a slice of the action, apparently.

**Step 3: International Side-Eye**  
But here‚Äôs the best part: Every time Israel retaliates, suddenly, **it‚Äôs Israel that gets the side-eye** from the international community. Imagine you‚Äôre in your house, dodging baseballs coming through your windows, and the minute you grab a bat to protect yourself, everyone‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúHey, chill out, Israel. Don‚Äôt overreact.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Iran‚Äôs sitting there sipping tea, saying, ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not *me* launching the rockets. I just happened to, uh, *supply* them.‚Äù

It's like Israel‚Äôs dealing with a professional arsonist who's also selling fire insurance on the side.

**Step 4: The Endless Proxy Parade**  
And if you think it stops with Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, think again. Iran‚Äôs proxy parade never ends. Just when you think you've handled one, another one shows up with a fresh delivery of rockets. It‚Äôs like that whack-a-mole game, but the moles have AK-47s and a grudge.

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of Iran‚Äôs **"Go Fight Israel for Me" Army**:

* **Hamas**: The OG proxy, Gaza-based rocket launchers who never met a ceasefire they didn‚Äôt break.
* **Hezbollah**: Lebanon‚Äôs missile maestros, always ready to send some love (by love, I mean rockets) from the north.
* **Houthis**: Yemen‚Äôs newest addition to the club, because apparently you can never have too many proxies launching missiles at Israel.

So, what does Israel do? Build a bigger umbrella. The Iron Dome keeps the worst of it out, but there's only so much you can do when your neighbors keep borrowing Iran‚Äôs bat.

**Step 5: The Meme of It All**  
Here‚Äôs where we get to my favorite part: the meme.

[https://imgflip.com/i/94zez4](https://imgflip.com/i/94zez4)

If Iran‚Äôs proxies were doors, the Grim Reaper would have already knocked on Hamas and Hezbollah‚Äôs doors, leaving a nice blood trail behind, and now he‚Äôs standing in front of the **Houthis' door**, scythe in hand, ready to make his next move. And Israel? Well, Israel‚Äôs stuck cleaning up the mess every time.

**Conclusion: What Now?**  
So yeah, it‚Äôs a tough gig being Israel in the Middle East right now. You‚Äôre stuck playing defense 24/7, dodging rockets like it‚Äôs a national sport, and half the world still points fingers at you for being "too harsh" when you fight back. Meanwhile, Iran just keeps finding new ways to stir the pot without ever showing up to the actual fight.

What‚Äôs next? Honestly, probably more of the same. More rockets, more finger-pointing, and more ‚ÄúWait, you want me to just *not* defend myself?‚Äù moments.

But hey, at least we get some memes out of it. Stay safe, Israel‚Äîyou‚Äôve got a lot of people throwing bats at your windows.

Title: Iran- another reason liberals should be pro-Israel
Content: Remember like a year ago when us liberals were heavily protesting against Iran for killing women and taking away their rights and forcing them to wear hijabs?

Well now the US and Israel are in proxy wars with Iran, and suddenly us liberals are on Irans side.

Today I saw a social media post from a fellow liberal rooting for Iran for helping attack Israel.

What is happening?  When did we suddenly start supporting Iran over the free feminist world???

Has anyone else seen similar switches in positions from their friends where they protested Iran and now are on Irans side?

To me this seems like a really clear case of cognitive dissonance and I‚Äôm wondering if others are noticing this as well.

Not only have us liberals dropped the ‚Äúbelieve all women‚Äù and ‚Äúrapes can never be justified‚Äù but now they‚Äôre ALSO siding with Iran who they were recently against for oppressing women and who are still very much oppressing women. 

Additional filler details:

This was a common liberal stance as presented by the alliance of liberals and democrats of Europe in Oct 2022-
‚ÄúEuropean liberals welcome the EU‚Äôs Foreign Affairs Council decision to sanction Iran following the ruling regime‚Äôs violent crackdown on protestors defending women‚Äôs rights and demand an unconditional and immediate end to all violence against the people of Iran. Iran‚Äôs military support to Russia‚Äôs illegal invasion of Ukraine cannot be accepted and needs to face further sanctions if not halted. ‚Äú

So basically they were against Irans oppression of women AND a against their proxy wars of the Russia Ukraine invasion, but then when they attack Israel their support suddenly turns to Iran as being the good guys.

Apparently, the Islamic Republic of Iran‚Äôs President Raisi‚Äôs helicopter has crashed in north west Iran.. Initial report suggests heavy fog and bad weather. Reports are suggesting the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran and his foreign minister did not survived the crash.

What would this mean for Israel, if indeed President Raisi has died ? 

1. How long will it take before Israel gets blamed for the helicopter crash of the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran?

2. How long will it take before USA gets blamed for the helicopter crash of the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran?

3. Does Israel have a secret weapon to create heavy fog ?

4. Assuming if the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran did die in the helicopter crash, will the Pro-Palestinian organizers start to mourn the death of one of the biggest financial backers of Hamas ? The pro-Palestinians were quite jubelient and pro-Islamic Republic of Iran when they fired 300+ drones and missiles at Israel.

5. Is it an act of God ? Who‚Äôs God? Did the Jewish God punished the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran ?

6. Did the Muslim God punished the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, also known as the butcher of Tehren for his sins and killings of the Iranian people ?

7. Could it be a power struggle within the political elites in the Islamic Republic of Iran ?

[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2024-09-25/ty-article/.premium/iran-and-russia-have-co-opted-israel-gaza-war-to-sow-chaos-in-western-democracies/00000192-2619-d646-abba-be5d53840000?gift=144e38bd6ddd483f91a4e87dd59fd49e



Here is a gift article from Haaretz, a left wing news source within Israel that actively opposed the current government and is highly critical of the war and the regime.
There has definitely been a sense that much of the outrage around this issue has been manufactured. Of course both sides call each other bots, but now there is hard evidence for the prevalence and scale of the issue. It's interesting to see how the double standard applied to Israel actually serves a purpose on a grand scale. Antisemitism is literally still performing a function for bad faith actors in 2024.

It‚Äôs become clear that Iran, China, and Russia actually don‚Äôt have values and merely define themselves in contrast to Western hegemony. It‚Äôs silly to see communists working with Islamists again, but ultimately it‚Äôs clear that for some groups seeing their enemies fall is more important than succeeding themselves. Is it possible that these countries have no problem applying this kind of propaganda because they allow no space for free thought anyway, so it doesn‚Äôt matter how much fake news there is? As long as you bow to Allah, or the Supreme leader, it doesn‚Äôt matter if what you think is true.

Do you think there is a way to actually manage this? Or are we in an age where media literacy means 'believe nothing llonline'? And what does that mean considering that media literacy of younger generations is abysmal.
If you support Palestine, do you see this as a legitimate tactic?

If you‚Äôre support Israel do you see this as beneficial or problematic?

If your opinions have developed in response to the media coverage since 10/7, does this change how you feel?

Title: Understanding Iran's role in the Israel-Palestine conflict
Content: *This post is about Israel and Iran, but I believe it belongs here since Iran plays a central role in the Israel‚ÄìPalestine conflict.*

After Israel‚Äôs recent strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, this subreddit has seen a surge of posts and comments asking: *How could Israel dare to attack a sovereign state? Why is Israel allowed to have nuclear weapons but Iran isn‚Äôt? Iranians did nothing wrong, where is the justice? Why hasn‚Äôt the world sanctioned Israel yet?*

I want to address this reaction by pointing out how many people here seem unaware of Iran‚Äôs role in creating and fueling this entire situation.

Following the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran declared two main enemies: The "Great Satan" and The "Little Satan". USA and Israel accordingly.

These weren‚Äôt just political rivals, they were framed as ideological threats. The US was labeled the symbol of global imperialism, and Israel its regional outpost. While this rhetoric may have been aimed primarily at rallying domestic support at the time, it has continued for more than four decades.

Iranian leaders have repeatedly vowed to destroy the "Zionist entity", calling Israel a cancer in the Middle East and promising revenge. And it hasn‚Äôt stopped at words. Iran has actively backed a network of proxy groups around Israel, funding, arming, and training them. Without Iran‚Äôs support, groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Houthis, and various Iraqi militias would not have the strength or capabilities they showed before October 7.

Iran‚Äôs broader strategy appears to be to encircle Israel and exhaust it through a prolonged, multi-front proxy war, not with other states, but with non-state actors. This makes it much harder for Israel to respond. Iran avoids direct conflict, and the countries hosting these proxies remain officially uninvolved. But if Israel retaliates, it risks being portrayed as the aggressor, targeting sovereign nations or civilians, which then triggers international condemnation and pressure through institutions like the UN.

Israel has always recognized that the real threat comes from Iran, but for a long time, it didn‚Äôt treat it as an immediate priority. Dealing with Iran‚Äôs proxies was challenging, but ultimately manageable. Everything changed when Iran came close to developing nuclear weapons. Personally, I find it hard to believe that Iran‚Äôs nuclear program is purely for peaceful energy. The country is ruled by a fanatic with absolute power. What's to stop him from launching a strike on a whim, out of anger or ideology?

This fundamentally shifted the situation. We're no longer talking about just proxy wars or conventional threats. Now, a state that has openly vowed to destroy Israel for over 40 years is potentially on the verge of acquiring the ultimate weapon. For Israel, this is simply unacceptable.

Trump tried to push through a nuclear deal, but from Israel‚Äôs perspective, why should it trust a regime that has made its total destruction a stated goal? It would be naive to believe that Iran will simply halt all nuclear development. Even under pressure or international agreements, a regime like this, driven by extreame ideology, will find ways to keep its plans alive, whether in secret or through loopholes.

In conclusion, as long as this regime remains in power in Iran, it will do everything it can to ensure the Israel-Palestine conflict is never resolved. A lasting peace would be a direct contradiction of the Islamic Revolution‚Äôs core narrative. It would force the regime to admit that, after decades of struggle and sacrifice, it failed to achieve its ultimate goal. That‚Äôs a truth they cannot afford to tell their own people. If, however, the regime were to change, even to one that was simply neutral toward Israel, then my own perspective would shift. I would be more critical of Israel, and I would see international pressure to establish a Palestinian state as entirely justified. At that point, sanctions and diplomatic efforts could make sense. But as long as the ayatollahs rule Iran, any serious conversation about peace, justice, or even sanctions is, in my view, pointless.

Title: Iran's Plan: Bring Down The Jordanian Regime, Attack Israel On All Fronts, Undermine Gulf States
Content: Jordan was already walking a [tightrope](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/jordan-gaza-protests-israel-abdullah-economy/) before the Gaza war. By autumn 2023, Jordan had been facing economic turmoil: unemployment rose to 22%, and polls were showing that 63% of Jordanian were considering emigrating, "a higher percentage than nearly insolvent Lebanon and conflict-ridden Iraq". According to the [Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/4084029-jordan-will-likely-be-irans-next-domino/), the Jordanian regime is perpetually on the brink of economic collapse, surviving "just barely, year after year, thanks only to favorable trade deals with Israel and aid from the West and the Gulf."

The woes have risen since the Gaza War began. Up to 60% of the Jordanians are of Palestinian origin, and most have voiced strong opposition to Israel's campaign in Gaza and Jordan's perceived complicity. 66% of Jordanians supported the Oct 7 attacks, breaking out in protests during which at least a thousand people were arrested by the Jordanian security forces. On the economic front, the Jordanian tourism-driven economy has taken a hit too.

In recent days, Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood has mounted [incitements](https://www.memri.org/reports/jordanian-regime-furious-hamas-muslim-brotherhood-they-are-acting-foment-chaos-kingdom) to take direct actions against Israel. More threateningly, a Hezbollah spokesperson in Iraq said on April 1 that the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which is a coalition of Iranian-backed militias, has prepared to ‚Äúequip‚Äù 12,000 ‚ÄúIslamic Resistance in Jordan‚Äù fighters with a significant supply of weapons. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) [states](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-april-2-2024) that, although the statement is "likely aspirational given the current strength of the Jordanian armed forces", it "indicates a growing Iranian interest in using Jordan in its anti-Israel campaign." 

Recent domestic unrest and large sustained demonstrations in Jordan against the Jordanian government‚Äôs Israel policy may be driving Iran and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq to approach Jordanian infiltration differently and more overtly. Thousands of Jordanians have demonstrated in front of the Israeli embassy in Amman since March 24. Protestors have repeatedly clashed with Jordanian security services, and the government has accused groups of stirring up ‚Äùstrife.‚Äù 

Understandably, this has raised security concerns for Arab Gulf states, for fear that their regimes could be next. The Saudi media has mobilised in support of Jordan. For example, on April 2, Al-Jazeera has recently published an article, translated by [MEMRI](https://www.memri.org/reports/irans-grand-plan-bring-down-jordanian-regime-attack-israel-east-and-thwart-western-sunni#_ednref9), stating that "The Saudi leadership, government, and people will not hesitate to stand alongside Jordan, as long as the developments in the situation demand it. This is because they [the Saudis] see Jordan's stability and security as integral to the stability and security of Saudi Arabia." Similarly, on April 2 the Palestinian Authority has [reiterated](https://www.memri.org/reports/irans-grand-plan-bring-down-jordanian-regime-attack-israel-east-and-thwart-western-sunni#_edn10), that it opposes "all the attempts to harm [Jordan's] security and stability or to use the suffering of the Palestinian people in the [Gaza] Strip to harm the Jordanian arena, [and their opposition also to] any external [i.e. Iranian] interference in Jordan's internal affairs.".

According to [ISW](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-april-2-2024) and [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/4084029-jordan-will-likely-be-irans-next-domino/), "if Iran manages to bring down the Jordanian regime, as it has others, then Israel‚Äôs destruction might suddenly become a far more realistic, near term prospect." An active and well-armed Iranian-backed militia based out of Jordan would dramatically advance Iran‚Äôs military encirclement of Israel. An expanding Axis of Resistance network in Jordan would also facilitate Iranian efforts in the West Bank. Jordanian territory also offers multiple ground routes through which Iran could move military materiel into the West Bank.

On a regional scale, "if Iran seizes control of Jordan through proxies, or undermines the government enough to replace the Hashemite leadership, it would [seriously weaken](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4404338-jordan-is-at-risk-of-falling-into-iranian-hands/) American and regional security. Approximately 3,000 American troops and the Muwaffaq Salti Air Base ‚Äî a launch pad for counter-ISIS operations ‚Äî would be threatened. U.S. military intelligence capacities in the region would suffer."

Obviously, the fall of the Hashemites would also be catastrophic for the Palestinians too. A destabilised Jordan, involved in a multi-front war against Israel, likely with participation from the West Bankers, would enable Israel, now facing a veritable existential threat, to expel the Palestinians across the River Jordan. 

Ever since 1979, Iran's Ayatollahs have [proclaimed](https://www.memri.org/reports/irans-grand-plan-bring-down-jordanian-regime-attack-israel-east-and-thwart-western-sunni#_edn10) that the Iranian revolution is the starting point of a "comprehensive Islamic Revolution" that would be achieved by exporting unrest. Iran‚Äôs victories in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen have shown that the danger is very real. Yet, according to [The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4404338-jordan-is-at-risk-of-falling-into-iranian-hands/), the U.S. seems largely paralysed in fear of sparkling the situation out of control. In conclusion, "without American support to weaken Iranian influence, the Shia crescent threatens to pull down a key American ally in the Arab world, which would be devastating to the entire region."

Title: What are the possibilities of a strike on Iran by Israel 
Content: What could be considered a soft target for an Israeli response 

Been weighing this up, 
1) Iranian civilian targets (power plants, refineries) I think this is a no, after Netanyahus speech appealing to the civilian population. 

2) Military barracks,  again I think no, Iranian footsoliders aren't going to be involved in any kind of land war against Israel.

3) Reactors and plutonium enrichment plants, this is a maybe for me. If Irans missiles were targeted at Israeli nuclear stockpiles , then there is a possibility of justification. 
Military airfields, not much of an airforce  in Iran to attack.

4) Drone processing plants/ballistic missile processing plants and stockpiles,  these are a strong yes for me.

5) For personnel,  the ayatollah is too high profile for me, but Mahmoud Ahmadinejad head of secret intelligence is a yes.

It maybe that airstrikes or missile launch isn't necessary,  the targets may already be compromised like Ismail Haniyeh.

But is Israeli retaliation worth it? Irans seems only to go for direct strikes when a high ranking official is assassinated.  There aren't many high ranking officials left in hezbollah or hamas. 


Since October 7 , damage that hezbollah and hamas can inflict on the Israeli population and military is minimal. As it progresses hamas and hezbollah will grow weaker militarily, they can't recruit from within with haste, this could lead to further infiltration from Israeli intelligence. 

I've seen a few tiktok videos claiming hezbollah has some kind of battle hardened special force waiting for the invasion into Lebanon. I don't believe there is any such force, and if their was it doesn't have satellites, airforce or weaponry capable to take on the idf. 

If hezbollah wants to survive,  it has to figure out a way to stop a land invasion into their territory.  



EDIT/UPDATE

wasn't what I expected,  details  still arnt clear , I'd not thought of strikes against Sam and radar sites as a priority. 

Yet thinking now I can't think of a better target, very unlikely russia will be able to provide replacements.   But even if they did it would be the same junk .

Title: The Cost of Escalation: What the Iran-Israel Clash Means ‚Äî James M. Dorsey Explains
Content: [https://jamesmdorsey.substack.com/p/the-cost-of-escalation-what-the-iran](https://jamesmdorsey.substack.com/p/the-cost-of-escalation-what-the-iran)

*There is a broader goal to this operation, which is one of regime change. It's fundamentally the same strategy that underlies Israel's operations in the Gaza Strip." ‚Äî James M. Dorsey talks to Modern Diplomacy‚Äô s* *Rahmeen Siddique.*

The Middle East is currently teetering on the brink of a regional conflagration, as the long-simmering shadow war between Iran and Israel has erupted into direct military confrontation. As award-winning journalist and scholar James M. Dorsey aptly highlighted in recent commentary, what we‚Äôve witnessed in the past 24-48 hours is a profound and unsettling shift, demanding a nuanced understanding of its strategic underpinnings and potential trajectories.

Israel‚Äôs recent ‚ÄúOperation Rising Lion‚Äù marks a pivotal moment. This wasn‚Äôt merely a retaliatory strike; it was a comprehensive and audacious offensive aimed at the heart of Iran‚Äôs military and nuclear infrastructure. As Dorsey points out, Israel has long harboured the desire to directly confront Iran‚Äôs nuclear ambitions, a move previously restrained by successive U.S. administrations. The operation‚Äôs targets ‚Äì Iran‚Äôs Defence Ministry, nuclear facilities at Natanz and Isfahan, and key IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists ‚Äì underscore a clear objective: to severely damage, if not dismantle, Iran‚Äôs nuclear program. Beyond that, the precision and effectiveness of these strikes, as Dorsey notes, unequivocally demonstrated a stunning degree of Israeli military and intelligence superiority.

But the strategic message goes deeper than just nuclear deterrence. Prime Minister Netanyahu has, as Dorsey articulated, hinted at a broader goal: regime change. This strategy mirrors Israel‚Äôs approach in Gaza, where collective punishment of the population is, in part, designed to foster an uprising against Hamas. Netanyahu‚Äôs explicit remarks yesterday, suggesting the attacks offered Iranians an opportunity to ‚Äúregain their freedom,‚Äù reveal a clear intent to leverage military pressure for internal political upheaval in Iran.

The timing of this significant Israeli strike, despite its ongoing involvement in Gaza, is crucial. Dorsey offers compelling insights into this decision-making. He suggests that Netanyahu read Washington‚Äôs stance astutely. While President Donald Trump initially cautioned against such a strike, the fact that the U.S. was informed in advance and subsequently evacuated non-essential personnel from Baghdad and other Middle Eastern capitals indicates a tacit, if reluctant, green light. Trump‚Äôs latest comments, praising the operation as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù and hinting at ‚Äúmore to come,‚Äù suggest he now perceives it as leverage to force Iran into a more amenable negotiating position, particularly regarding the nuclear deal. Trump‚Äôs transactional approach to diplomacy, where demands are laid out with threats of severe consequences, plays directly into this. This isn‚Äôt to say Trump pre-planned it, but he is certainly ‚Äúgetting on the bandwagon,‚Äù as Dorsey put it.

Furthermore, the operation serves to restore Israel‚Äôs military and intelligence credibility, which some might argue was perceived as dented by the protracted conflict in Gaza. While Israel has achieved significant military objectives in Gaza, it has not fully occupied or administered the Strip, leading to a perception of an incomplete victory. The strikes on Iran, therefore, project an image of decisive power and capability. A ‚Äúcherry on top‚Äù for Netanyahu, as Dorsey highlights, was the postponement of a French-Saudi conference aimed at furthering a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This temporarily shifts the focus away from Gaza and Palestinian issues, which is a strategic win for Israel‚Äôs current government.

The extent of U.S. involvement in this strike, and going forward, remains a critical question. While the U.S. was informed, its direct participation in the strike is unlikely. However, future involvement will depend heavily on Iran‚Äôs response. Should Iran target U.S. bases in the region, or French or British facilities, the calculus would change dramatically. Dorsey also points to a significant domestic dynamic within the U.S.: a split in Trump‚Äôs Republican base, with some senior members supporting Israel‚Äôs actions, while others, including influential conservative commentators, emphasize that this is ‚Äúnot our war.‚Äù This division could complicate Trump‚Äôs ability to fully commit U.S. resources if the conflict broadens.

Iran‚Äôs retaliatory strike on alleged Israeli intelligence sites, while not new in concept (Dorsey notes similar actions last year), adds another layer to the dangerous escalation. The Iranian claim of possessing vast Israeli nuclear documents, while unverified unlike Israel‚Äôs public release of Iranian nuclear archives, serves as a propaganda counterpoint, highlighting the information warfare aspect of this conflict.

The regional and international implications are profound. The Gulf states, unlike in 2015 when they viewed Iran as an imminent threat needing to be countered, now prioritize economic cooperation and freezing differences. They are deeply concerned about a full-blown war, as evidenced by Saudi Arabia‚Äôs strong condemnation of Israel‚Äôs operations. Any attack on American facilities in the Gulf, which would place these states on the front lines, is a grave concern. Russia and China, while observing, also have their own strategic interests at play, particularly concerning energy stability and regional influence.

Can the U.S. leverage this situation to force Iran back to the nuclear deal? Dorsey is sceptical. He emphasizes that the Iranian regime has endured 46 years of varying degrees of pressure without bowing. While the 2015 nuclear agreement might have been seen as a concession, Iran has consistently maintained it does not seek nuclear weapons. Iran‚Äôs decision to enrich uranium to 60% was, in Dorsey‚Äôs view, a direct consequence of Trump‚Äôs 2018 withdrawal from the JCPOA, a gradual violation of the agreement‚Äôs terms in response to American pressure. Iran, in this sense, is ‚Äúa victim of its own strategy.‚Äù

Finally, the prospect of regime change in Iran through external intervention is highly unlikely. As Dorsey aptly asks, there are very few historical examples where external forces have successfully brought about popular regime change, rather than merely installing a new regime. Iranians, he asserts, if they desire liberation, will have to achieve it themselves; it will not come from the air force of another country.

The critical question now is de-escalation. While an Iranian refusal to attend the sixth round of U.S.-Iranian nuclear negotiations would not be surprising, Dorsey suggests it would be wise for them to go, even if it‚Äôs out of character. The framing of any refusal as a postponement rather than a cancellation, linked to the cessation of Israeli strikes, offers a sliver of hope for future dialogue. We are undoubtedly in for a prolonged cycle of retaliation, at least in the coming days. The crucial factor will be whether both sides can eventually claim a degree of ‚Äúvictory‚Äù sufficient to halt the escalation, preventing this perilous new chapter from spiraling into an all-out regional catastrophe.

In this timely commentary, award-winning journalist and scholar James M. Dorsey unpacks the deeper implications of the recent Iran-Israel escalation. From regional power dynamics to global repercussions, he offers sharp, incisive insights into what this confrontation reveals‚Äîand what might come next

Title: Israel Intensifies Threats Against Iran's Khamenei
Content: # [Israel Intensifies Threats Against Iran's Khamenei](https://www.verity.news/story/2025/netanyahu-vows-to-hit-all-iran-nuclear-sites-amid-us-talks?p=re3608)

# The Facts

* Israel escalated its threats against the Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on Thursday as ongoing strikes between the two countries continue.
* During a tour of the Soroka Medical Center,¬†[which was struck on Wednesday by an Iranian missile](https://www.verity.news/story/2025/trump-weighs-iran-strike-as-israel-hits-nuclear-sites), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he had given explicit instructions that "no one is immune" in Iran after being asked by reporters if Israel would target Khamenei.
* On the same day, the Israeli Defense Minister, Israel Katz, also told reporters in the city of Holon that Khamenei "can no longer be allowed to exist" as "he personally gives the order to fire on hospitals," referencing the strike on the Soroka Medical Center.
* In an interview with the public broadcaster KAN, Netanyahu also expressed confidence that Israel has the "capability" to "achieve all our objectives and hit all of their nuclear facilities" and will do so with or without U.S. support, which he said was "entirely \[President Donald Trump's\] decision."
* Meanwhile, Iran has issued evacuation orders for Israeli broadcaster Channel 14, which it calls a "propaganda channel" for Netanyahu. According to a screenshot of the warning shared by the Iranian state-owned media outlet PressTV, the strike could occur "in the coming days."
* Elsewhere, in a message delivered by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Trump announced that he will decide his course of action "within the next two weeks" because of a "substantial chance of negotiations ‚Ä¶ with Iran in the near future."

**The Spin**

**Pro-US narrative**

Given the potential repercussions of U.S. intervention, Trump is rightly taking a cautious approach. As the conflict's cost to the regime increases, the chance that Iran will enter negotiations becomes ever greater. The president's pause gives Iran a chance to concede its nuclear program in exchange for a reprieve while maintaining pressure on the regime.

**Pro-Israel narrative**

The attack on the Soroka Medical Center was an abominable crime that warrants a fierce response. Given that Khamenei is deliberately approving attacks on defenseless civilians, Netanyahu is right to instruct the IDF to strike at any viable target, including the Iranian supreme leader, to bring the conflict to a swift end and protect Israel's security.

**Pro-Iran narrative**

Channel 14 has long acted as a propaganda wing of the Israeli government and is complicit in its crimes. The network's headquarters, therefore, are a legitimate target for Iranian forces. Iran's war, however, is not against innocent bystanders, which is why it has warned of the strike in advance to reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties.

Title: Why Israel and Palestine is about to become forgotten as IRAN gets invaded
Content: I‚Äôve been saying this since October 7th- the Middle East is about to change. 

Take it how you want but nobody who‚Äôs served in the IDF can wrap their minds around how over 1000 terrorists were able to not only break in, but get in, and go back without getting Apachid out of existence. 

Ex boarder watch soldiers and intelligence officers I spoke with personally said it‚Äôs virtually impossible, but quickly stopped responding in days to come. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm not saying this is an inside job, but I‚Äôm also not saying that the CIA doesn‚Äôt sign off on everything that happens in the world. 

 It‚Äôs pretty obvious to most this isn‚Äôt Israel Vs Hamas. China is weakening US influence in Europe via Russia, and US influence in the Middle East via Iran. US is due to lose a lot of power if Iran gets nuclear power, and as BRICS becomes a bigger and bigger threat to the petro dollar.

When I saw October 7th I already said and put my money where my mouth is bought Gold options which are up 25% since October 8th when I bought them.

Iran will be invaded by US and a regime change as a goal. I can‚Äôt say it will happen now or under Trump. But the recent events show an interesting move, that one can interpreted a certain way.

1. Israel hits aid workers 
2. US condemns it and says an immediate ceasefire is necessary and headlines like ‚Äú US and Israel are coming apart‚Äù are being pushed 
3. Israel kills an Iranian top commander and targets Iranian consulate in Syria 
4. Iran must revenge, and is now more then ever motivated to do so due to seeming weakening relations between US and Israel
5. Israel is inviting this retaliation and continues to strike in Southern Lebanon daily 
6. This looks like it might be an open invitation for Iran to strike, which will push US to get invovled out of necessity, and will ultimately become a US invasion of Iran and regime change 

This might not happen now, or it might happen later with a different event, but it‚Äôs never been this close, all regimes like Iran end up falling CIA is working around the clock to keep US supremacy, and Hamas will be forgotten so will Gaza once this takes place.

Title: I am becoming more Pro-Israel and I feel guilty about it.
Content: please consider my perspective, I am COMPLETELY open to listening to both sides with an open mind without attacks. I have done research but there is still a lot more to go.


I (25F) am a South Asian girl who lives in the UK. I am not a Muslim, but my best friend is a devout hijabi and I have plenty of muslim friends. Where I am from, there is a huge muslim population. London is a few hours away from me, and I hear North has a big population of Jewish people but I have never met a Jewish person before. therefore, many people I surround myself with are are Pro-Palestine, and admittedly, I was for a very long time, as I didn‚Äôt justify hearing of IDF soldiers gunning down innocent children and women, and still don‚Äôt. however, it is extremely difficult for me to completely justify what Hamas do. they are worth billions of dollars, why do they not fund the people of Palestine or even build bomb shelters, I have read there are none in Palestine. they just allow these people to suffer, yet Israel get blamed? and when I ask my muslim friends about this, they shrug it off as if they don‚Äôt want to think about it. someone even once told me that I shouldn‚Äôt be questioning Hamas, I should be questioning Israel - I think I have the right to question anyone who practices wrongdoing, of course including Israel, of course I was an advocate for Palestine for many years.


worse yet, I see Jewish people being shamed for being Zionists, when as bad as it sounds I‚Äôve started to feel like there‚Äôs nothing wrong with Israel being a Jewish state? the Middle East have MANY Muslim countries where people have been murdered or have had to flee because of their Judaism, Jews weren‚Äôt even historically safe in Europe (Nazi Germany for example), where exactly is it they should go? historically, Islam has been spread by the sword. Afghanistan used to be a Buddhist country, Iran was Zoroastrian, MANY countries have had Islam forced on them through conquests and dynasties, to me the Free Palestine campaign is starting to look a little more like this. and unfortunately, when I did research it is evident that Israel was a concept first. yes it wasn‚Äôt officially established until 1948, but the Torah and Bible have multiple mentions of Israel, and Islam wasn‚Äôt a thing at the time. also, the ‚ÄòIsraelis aren‚Äôt from Israel‚Äô argument is pretty flawed when a lot of Palestinians descended from Egypt and Jordan.


I think that a two-state Solution is the most feasible, and dare I say realistic, but I‚Äôve read that it was Palestine who have historically rejected any treaties for a two-state solution, hence why attacks continue to happen to Palestinians. I watched a video on an arab person whose family survived the Nakba generations ago, and he said that it‚Äôs because his family simply agreed to live peacefully with the Jews. he lives in Israel and said he now has the same rights as any other Jew, and profusely denies the claim that what‚Äôs happening in Palestine is a genocide. the fact that 2 million arabs live peacefully in Israel is extremely telling in itself. if anything, from what I‚Äôve seen the Palestinians almost rejoice when someone they know and love dies. as far as Islam extremism demonstrates, it appears that they‚Äôve been brainwashed into thinking if they die they martyred for their country, and they will go straight to heaven. I saw another video of a woman saying ‚Äúalhamdullilah‚Äù knowing someone got killed, and that he died for the liberation of Palestine. to me it just seems so backwards and f-ed up.


this kinda turned into more of a rant than anything, but it‚Äôs difficult to openly discuss this with people who are extremely Pro-Palestine and sort of brush off the historical spread of Islam, and the means to which it spread. their argument that Israel are colonisers is hypocritical and contradictory to a fault. I feel guilty for having these opinions as I am surrounded by Muslim people I love, and I can't talk to them about this or else they will judge me instantly, and now I feel like how a lot of Jews around the world currently feel. I don‚Äôt think I would feel safe in Palestine, however I was considering doing a solo trip to Tel Aviv (without telling literally anybody), because I want to see and learn things with my own eyes, but I‚Äôm paranoid about my passport being stamped and I have a strange thought that I‚Äôd get detained at another airport and turned away for even visiting Israel.


I am open to hearing sides of Pro-Palestinians, and I am open to explanations from every point I‚Äôve mentioned in the above paragraph. but as it stands, am yisrael chai.

Title: I am BAFFLED how people can‚Äôt see this obvious pattern in the world
Content: Every country that‚Äôs ever existed in the Middle East or near it that is not ruled by a Muslim government has been attacked repeatedly by radical Islamist groups backed by governments like Iran, Qatar, and Pakistan.

Look at what just happened to India! 

For Gods sake! How many genocides are conducted by Islamic extremists every year throughout the world, and most people don‚Äôt even care or notice!!!

Look at the Sudan - the largest ongoing genocide in the world, with 500,000 killed and 2.7 million displaced!!

Islam rules over 99.75% of the Middle East. That little 0.25% of the Middle East called Israel is a black eye to Islamic fundamentalists.

Do people not realize that over 99% of Jews have escaped, been expelled from, or murdered in Islamic Middle Eastern countries since 1948? 

Do people even care that Jews continuously face genocide from these radicals from every direction, but as soon as Israel starts a war against one of these terrorist groups who committed one of the worst ACTUAL acts of genocide in modern history, all of these idiots point the finger at Israel for defending itself from this radical terrorist group and demanding the return of its civilian hostages?

THESE ISLAMIC JIHADISTS ARE THE RACISTS, THE COLONIZERS, THE CONDUCTORS OF GENOCIDE, AND THE WAR CRIMINALS AND THEY HAVE MANAGED TO CONVINCE THE IGNORANT OF THE WORLD TO POINT THEIR FINGERS AT ISRAEL AND TO IGNORE ALL OF THE ATROCITIES THEY ARE COMMITTING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

Edit: I wanted to add the words from the UAE Foreign Minister from 2017

Title: Netanyahu has another message to the Iranian people : Khamenei regime fears the people of Iran more than Israel.
Content: https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-to-iranians-another-attack-on-israel-would-cripple-irans-economy/

1. The last time Netanyahu sent a direct message to the Iranian people was on Sept 30th. The very next day, on Oct 1st, Tehran launched about 200 ballistic missiles at targets in Israel. Coincidence ? I think not. After this new message from Netanyahu, will Tehran once again be so outraged and start launching another wave of retaliation against Israel ?

2. Netanyahu received some criticism on his first direct message to the Iranian people from certain groups that he didnt spoke Persian, there were no Persian subtitles etc‚Ä¶ and that group wrongly concluded that Netanyahu‚Äôs message was not meant for Iranian but for the English speaking world. However in this new message, there were Persian subtitles in his video and he even chanted Women, Life, Freedom in the Persian language. 

https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1856382472646185393 (in English with Persian subtitles this time)

3. It would seem he is trying to get the Iranian people to overthrow the Ayatollah regime. I wonder what else Israel and Netanyahu is will be doing because that video message wont be enough ? He also talked about a future for free Iran and free Iranian people, free from the Ayatollah and a future friendship with Israel building prosperity and peace. Netanyahu is probably the only world leader who spoke about a future free Iran and free Iranian people. 

4. Have you noticed since Trump won the US Presidential election, Tehran has gotten really quiet ? Tehran was making lots of noise and threats just before the election, but after Trump won, silence‚Ä¶. Iran's supreme leader says enemies will receive 'crushing response'  https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3yqzx72zno. Is Khamenei afraid of Trump ? It is alledged Tehran tried to assasinate Trump. Trump is famous for being unforgiving, vindictive and petty, Trump is not going to forgive and forget that stunt Tehran did, trying to kill him and will want to exact revenge.

Title: Polls in Israel after the Iran attack
Content: * For the first time since Oct7, **Benjamin Netanyahu and Likud** leads with 27 seats.
* Naftali Bennett with a new Center-Right, anti-Bibist party gets **24 seats**
* **Avigdor Lieberman's Liberal-Right** party is the 3rd biggest party. 'Israel our home' party gets 11 seats.
* **Yair Golan's 'The Democrats'** party, Moderate-Left, gets **11 seats** as well.
* The middle-class religious party **Shas** gets 10 seats
* **Yair Lapid's** cenrtist party 'There is Future' (Yesh atid) falls with 7 seats
* Benny Gantz's party gets 7 seats as well
* The haredi party gets 7 seats.
* Itamar Ben-Gvir's **Jewish Power** Far-Right populist party falls, probably lost 3/4 seats to Netanyahu, and they get **6 seats.**
* The Arab communist party "Hadash" gets **6 seats** as well
* The Conservative Arab party gets **4 seats.**
* In the polls, the Religious Zionist Party fails to pass the electoral threshold.

The opposition will still form a government and Bennett will still be prime minister, but by a smaller margin than in previous polls. The attack on Iran causes Ben Gvir's hard-right mandates to go to Netanyahu, including one mandate for Bennett. Bennett's voters are mostly center/right-wingers who are fed up with Netanyahu.

Even in the opposition, most parties tend towards a more liberal social direction, but are very hawkish on security issues and oppose a Palestinian state. Benny Gantz will not be prime minister because he is seen as weak, spineless, flatters the ultra-Orthodox and tries to please everyone. Lapid loses seats from both the center-right and the center-left.

Classical left-wing voters who still speak in terms of ceasefires and a Palestinian state find a home with Yair Golan, who holds an ideology and platform that are more friendly to the international community and the Democratic Party in the United States, while his security experts are also people who had ties to the Biden and Obama administrations (maybe that's why he's dropping in the polls?), including his unfortunate statements about the army. He apparently forgot that he wasn't running for the American Democratic Party nomination but is running in the Israeli public. In addition, his voters hold a much more aggressive attitude towards the government, which is why he is uniting the left around him (similar to Bernie Sanders).

Title: Why I changed from Pro-Palestine to Pro-Israel as an Irish person. Please help correct anything I may have gotten wrong, or missed out. 
Content: As an Irish Catholic, all of my family and friends are Pro-Palestine. Tbh I still wouldn't really say I am pro one side or the other, as it is a complex conflict and not like choosing sides in a football match. I feel sorry for innocent people on both sides. However, the more I learn, the more I sympathise with the Israeli perspective. I honestly think that the Pro-Palestine side is heavily reliant on 'buzzwords' which sound good on social media posts or when chanted on the streets, and twists a lot of the facts. For example, the way they frame the entire conflict is that of white settler-colonist Jews oppressing the poor indigenous brown people of Palestine. This resonates a lot with people in Ireland, who see it as equivalent to the long Irish struggle for national independence against the British. Indeed, people will point out that the British politician Balfour is a key figure behind both the partition of Palestine and the partition of Ireland/Northern Ireland. I now believe this to be a false equivalence. 

This is my current understanding. It may be imperfect and please help correct me....

For a start, the majority of Jews in Israel aren't white. I think it's sad that this racial element is so important, but apparently it is. The Middle-Eastern, or 'Mizrahi' Jews are the largest Jewish group in Israel. They considerably outnumber the 'Ashkenazi' Jews, or Jews of European descendent. More importantly, even the Jews of European descendent ultimately trace their heritage back to the Levant. At the end of the day, Jews come from Judea and Arabs come from Arabia. This is an over-simplification. But it is true that Jewish culture and ethnicity has been in the Levant for at least 3,000 years. The Jews were exiled from their homeland by the Romans 2,000 years ago. The Romans renamed the land 'Palestine'; it is not an Arabic word. Arab culture and religion came in the form of conquest after the invention of Islam in the 7th Century. Arab Muslim conquerers built the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock over the ruins of the temple on the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. By now Arab/Islamic culture has been in the region for well over 1,000 years, so they should also be considered native. 

Since the beginning of their exile 2,000 years ago, Jews have faced persecution wherever they went, either as 'Christ-killers', or as people who rejected the final Prophet, or later as racially impure. However, Jews never fully left their homeland, but remained a minority under centuries of Colonial rule by the Arab Caliphates and later the Ottoman Empire. Despite what most people in Ireland seem to think, the modern state of Israel was not created as a colony under British Imperialism. Jewish settlers began returning to their ancestral homeland to escape persecution in Europe from the late 1800's onwards, purchasing land from Arabs and from absentee landowners in Istanbul. They came as refugees, not conquerors. At that time Palestine was a backwater of the Ottoman Empire and its population was a faction of what it is today. Jewish settlers brought advanced agricultural and medical technology from Europe and helped transform the land and enable it to support a larger population. 

The Jewish persecution ultimately culminated in the Holocaust and the murder of 6 million Jews, at which point the world agreed that the Jews should have their own state. The UN decided to vote the state of Israel into existence - as part of a 2 state solution - in 1948 (a vote from which Britain actually abstained). Instead of accepting the democratic decision of the majority of the world's nations, Israel's bigger more powerful neighbours (Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq) decided to invade and try to wipe out the early state. Somehow Israel managed to win this war, but hundreds of thousands of Palestines were displaced as a result. My understanding is that many were told by the Arab armies to flee during the war and promised they would be able to return home after the inevitable destruction of Israel. On the Jewish side, hundreds of thousands of Jews in North Africa and the Middle East - who had been there since the time of the Roman exile - were forced by the governments of those countries to leave. For example, before 1948 Morocco had around 250,000 Jews and today it has less than 2,000. Iraq had 150,000 Jews, but today less than 5. Talk about 'ethnic cleansing'. The majority of the Jews of Israel today are the descendants of these refugees ('Mizrahi' Jews). I believe so much death and suffering could have been avoided if the Arab nations had accepted this 1948 partition plan. 

Since 1948 Israel's Arab Muslim majority neighbouring countries invaded it 4 more times (6 days war, Yom Kippur War, etc.) and each time Israel has won. I believe a big factor in this is the effectiveness of military organisation in democratic states in contrast to authoritarian states. Since then, dictators in authoritarian regimes in the Middle East have had an incentive to keep the conflict alive in order to present themselves as champions of the Palestinian cause and distract from internal human rights issues in their own regimes. Therefore neighbouring countries have continued to deny subsequent generations of Palestinian refugees citizenship and equal rights. However, by 2023 Israel was in the process of normalising relationships with the Arab Muslim states in peace negotiations facilitated by Saudi Arabia. The greatest antagonist in the Middle East today (Iran) could not tolerate this, so planned for its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah to launch attacks on Israel beginning with the atrocities of Oct 7th. 

This is where I believe the ability of an Irish person to understand the conflict breaks down completely. If we consider the 2 major groups of the Palestinian resistance movement to be the 'PLO' (Palestinian Liberation Organisation) and Hamas, I believe the average Irish person can see reflections of the 'IRA' (Irish Republican Army) in the PLO. They are non-state actors willing to use violent means to achieve regional nationalistic goals. A free and united Irish state, a free Palestinian state. Tbh I think the PLO are much more fanatical than the IRA and harder to negotiate with. In the 1970's - Black September - the PLO tried to assassinate the King of Jordan and started a civil war. They got kicked out of Jordan and moved to Lebanon where they started a civil war that transformed the country from one of the most stable countries in the Middle East to the Lebanon of today in which a third of the country is ruled by a terrorist organisation. 4 times the PLO were offered a 2 state solution, and everything they were asking for, and each time they rejected it. In the 1990s the PLO supported Saddam Hussein's genocidal persecution of the Kurds. In contrast, in the 1990s the IRA disarmed and accepted a peace agreement that would see Northern Ireland remain part of the UK until such time as - through democratic referendum - the majority of the population chose to leave the UK and reunite with the Republic of Ireland. 

Unfortunately, I believe the PLO are still more reasonable actors than Hamas, who are not interested in regional nationalistic goals such as the creation of a Palestinian state, but follow a globalist ideology of Jihad. If I understand correctly, Hamas don't even believe in the concept of the nation-state and believe that humans shouldn't be divided into different nationalities; there should just be Muslims and non-Muslims. They seek to re-establish the Islamic Caliphate. The fanatical Shia Mullahs of Tehran - who train and fund Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis - believe that global conflict is a prerequisite for the return of the Mahdi and the end of the world. This includes key events in modern day Syria, Yemen and the return of the Jews to the Holyland (specifically Jerusalem). From an Irish perspective - concerned with regional nationalistic struggle - it is almost impossible to empathise with this point of view, or how organisations could seriously base their geopolitical strategy on such eschatological nonsense. For this reason, Irish people are completely blind to this aspect of the conflict. But this is exactly what Hamas and Hezbollah believe and why they can't be negotiated with. They live in a different reality in which life in the secular world is unimportant compared to the eternal hereafter. Hamas leaders have even declared that they love death as much as the Jews and Americans love life. 

  
The IRA, as bad as they might have been, were motivated by nationalism, not religious fanaticism and would never have engaged in the kind of violence against women and children that was undertaken by Hamas on Oct. 7th. Many Irish people unfortunately see that day as an uprising similar to the Easter Rising of Irish rebels against the British government in Ireland in 1916. They can't see the conflict as anything but a nationalistic struggle against colonial oppression. Because how could anyone seriously believe in that kind of religious end-of-the-world religious nonsense? And this is what leads Irish people to view the conflict through the lens of the other key buzzwords; 'genocide' and 'apartheid' state. After all, the actions of the British government continuing to export food from Ireland during the potato famine were arguably genocidal, and Catholics remained second class citizens in the apartheid state in Ireland created by the Protestant Ascendancy of the 17th Century. Never mind that almost 20% of Israel citizens are Arab Muslim, some of which are lawyers, doctors, members of the Supreme Court. I believe that Arab Muslims in Israel have more rights and a higher quality of life than Arab Muslims in almost any other country in the Middle East. The benefits of living in a liberal democracy as opposed to living under a dictatorship or theocracy. And from what I understand the road signs are in Hebrew, Arabic and English, which would be a very unusual step for an apartheid state to take. 

It might not be surprising therefore that there are thousands of Arab Muslim Israelis in the IDF, as well as other religious and ethnic minorities such as Christians and Druze, who know how much better their lives are under a democratic government than they would be under an authoritarian or Islamic government like Hamas. I don't know how they expect us to believe that an army is committing genocide against a specific ethnic group, when that army itself has thousands of soldiers from that same ethnic group. There were zero Bosniak Muslim soldiers in the Serbian army in the actual genocide in Bosnia in the 1990s. The numbers also don't add up. 2 million people in Gaza, 44,000 dead, half of which are Hamas terrorists. The death of a single innocent civilian is heartbreaking, but it is a tragically unavoidable part of war. I believe many on the Pro-Palestine side are naive regarding the difference between war and genocide. The absolute number seems low for a genocide (compared to other ongoing conflicts in the region; 600,000 dead in Syria, 400,000 dead in Yemen). Also the combatant:civilian death ratio 1:1 or maybe 1:1.5, whereas a typical modern urban war involves more like 4, 5 or 6 civilian deaths for every 1 combatant. 

The fact that so many people are fixated on the number of dead is also unusual I think, and not typical of any previous conflicts. I truly believe that if social media and smartphones had existed during WW2, many supporters of the Pro-Palestinian movement would have been posting videos on TikTok of German children being pulled from the rubble and saying 'We have to have a ceasefire now, too many German civilians have been killed. The Allies are clearly evil. Let's give the Nazis time to regain their strength and build up their technology, but we just have to have a ceasefire now.' 

One side is completely based on buzzwords, street protests and social media 'influencers'. The depressing part is that no one has the time to look into the history or geopolitical and religious nuances of the conflict, it's so much easier to watch a short TikTok video with emotional background music, or shout buzzwords in a street protest. The likelihood I will be able to convince any of my friends or family to re-evaluate the nuances of the conflict are so close to zero as to basically not be worth attempting.

Title: About the support of Iran right now, let's clear a few things up.
Content: ***I want to make someting abundantly clear*** to all of you blindly supporting Iran right now:

Iran has spent the last 40+ years attacking, plotting attacks, and in many cases arming their proxies to attack and take over in, countries such as:

* Israel
* Gaza
* Lebanon
* United States
* Saudi Arabia
* Yemen
* European countries

***Do you understand:***

1. Any nukes Iran would aim at Israel will effectively harm and/or kill Palestinians in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza too?
2. Iran is funding much terror in the Middle East in Yemen, Lebanon and Gaza, including the October 7th attacks? So yeah, they are not innocent at ALL.
3. The IRGC, Houthis, Hezbollah and Hamas Iranian proxies *treat their civilian populations like human garbage*?
4. By supporting Iran right now, you are effectively supporting:
   * China
   * North Korea
   * Russia
   * The horrible treatment of civilians in Yemen, Lebanon, Gaza and Iran

***Ask yourself:***

* Why was the IAEA just about to sanction Iran over noncompliance for the nuclear program?
* Why was Iran forbidding IAEA watchdogs from accessing certain nuclear sites and monitoring equipment?
* Why are countries like France, Jordan and Saudi Arabia supporting Israel in the quest to get rid of Iran's Nukes?
* What do those countries have to *gain* by supporting Israel? If anything, the have everything to lose by supporting Israel.
* Why on earth would any of those countries corroborate Israel's credible threats if they didn't need to when they clearly dislike Israel?
* What will happen if Iran makes nukes and shares them with their proxies?
   * Do you think you and your Pro-Palestinian friends will somehow be safe from them?
   * Do you think the civilians in Iran, Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen will be safe from them when their own brutal paramilitary Iran proxies treat them like garbage?
   * You think they will somehow only kill Jews in Israel and everyone else will be spared?

Israel is far from perfect, they deserve plenty of criticism for their actions. But blindly supporting the Iranian regime simply because you don't like what Israel is doing in Gaza makes *ZERO* sense if you care about humans in the world at all. Israel can take blame for it's actions ***and*** also simultaneously not deserve to be nuked. Two things can be and are true at once.

***So I ask you:***

* Are you capable of holding these two truths at once?
* Are you capable of supporting the Iranian people without supporting the brutal Iranian regime who oppresses it's own people and publicly executes them?

Edit: I'm not asking anyone to support Israel. It's not a zero sum game where you must pick a side. I'm asking people to use critical thinking skills to understand why you may not want to align with Iran.

Title: Why can't Palestinians leave Israel and settle in Iran or Syria?
Content: The war started by the  terrorist group HAMAS with kidnapping inncoent civilians is unjustifiable. I have seen Twitch streamers like HASANPIKER justifying this and claiming it was in response to settlers' action in the west bank. But the problem is latter is legal and is not breaking any laws. Palestinians signed the Oslo accord giving the Israeli govt. control over the same mentioned land. So my question is simple, if Palestinians want to live in Israeli govt. controlled areas, then why don't accept Israeli passport? Or else move out of Israel.

Title: Could Israel use a strategic nuclear weapon on Iran to prevent its nuclear program?
Content: I have been having this thought recently but I'm posting this question here because I'm ignorant of the more practical matters on the ground. 

Thinking about Israel, Iran, and the lessons from history; I think there are only two things that are absolutely true about the both of the parties;

1. Iran has a fanatical urge to bring an end to Israel's existence as a state.

2. Israel (especially after Oct. 7th) has a fanatical urge to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear capable country.

And as things currently stand; now is the best time for Iran to become a nuclear capable country as their Axis of Resistance is getting severely weakened. 

Israel, who is a nuclear capable country, would have to strike very hard on Iran in the places where it's due to prevent it from becoming a nuclear capable country, considering that to destroy Iran's ability to develop and deploy a nuclear weapon would require Israel to deliver a finishing blow to Iran's key sites that could only be done decisively with a strategic nuclear weapon, I presume. 

Yes, the US with its current administration will not approve this, and Israel will become immediately an international pariah (as if it hasn't already; contributing more to its sense to forgo it's international standing as it's a lost cause already). 

Plus, the use of nuclear weapons for any purpose is the highest of taboos in international politics that even a state like Iran might not expect Israel to take such a radical action in order to prevent it from acquiring even a single nuclear warhead; which is exactly why Israel may choose to undertake this radical course of action. 

And if those key Iranian sites are located somewhere far from civilian areas, and the hypothetical nuclear weapons that could be used to strike are something less than the Tsar Bomba, would it really be that amoral if no civilian casualties (or at least a miniscule amount) would be involved? 

I'm posting this thought primarily to find some faults in my logic... So thank you for the engagement.

Title: Israel-Iran Conflict Escalating
Content: As I'm sure many of you know, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a brigadier general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard and nuclear scientist who was allegedly the head of Iran's nuclear weapons program, was assassinated in Iran a few days ago. This assassination follows the unconfirmed reported assassination of Abu Muhammad al-Masri, Al Qaeda's #2, in Tehran in August and the assassination of a senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard commander in Syria near the Iraqi-Syria border sometime between this previous Saturday and Sunday.

These assassinations come on the tails of the January assassination of Islamic Revolutionary Guard major general and commander of the Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani.

While we know that the US ordered and carried out the assassination of Soleimani with Israeli help (or at the very least Israeli approval of the assassination), we have no official recognition of the other three assassinations.

Fakhrizadeh has been confirmed dead by Iran, but no one has claimed responsibility. What we do know is that Iran seems to strongly believe that Israel carried it out, and the circumstantial evidence does lead me to believe that it was in fact Israel.

Abu Muhammad al-Masri's assassination has not been confirmed by the US, Israel, Iran, or Al Qaeda, but multiple anonymous American intelligence officials who contributed to the reporting of the assassination claim that the assassination did in fact happen and that it was Israel that carried it out with intel and coordination from the US. I don't really have any reason to believe this didn't happen and that it didn't happen this way.

Finally, this recent drone strike that killed a yet unnamed senior commander in Iran's military has been confirmed by Iraqi officials. Syrian news is reporting that it appears to be carried out by the US, but once again no one has claimed responsibility yet. I'd say that it was definitely either the US or Israel given the recent history of the US droning areas near the Iraq-Syria border over the past couple of years and the recent Israeli droning of Iranian targets in Syria over the past few weeks. Whoever carried it out, it benefited both the US and Israel.

While Israel and Iran are not yet on the brink of war, recent developments have pushed the decades-old conflict in that direction. With reports coming out that Trump might increase engagement against Iran before he leaves office, the Knesset reportedly telling the IDF to make preparations for the chance that the US attacks Iran, and several high-profile assassinations of high-up Iranian military personnel and operatives in the past three months, full-blown confrontation cannot be ruled out. To make matters worse, Biden has stated that he plans to negotiate with Iran on a nuclear deal that would most likely be very similar, if not identical, to the deal Obama negotiated in 2015. Israel has made it very clear that they do not think that such a deal will make the region safer, or even that Iran will comply with a deal, and that such a deal will increase the threats against Israel. If the US and Iran were to reenter a nuclear deal, Israel will feel less secure and be more likely to take matters into their own hands.

We may be headed towards all out war between Israel and Iran. Based on what happens in the coming weeks/months, either Israel, Iran, or both may decide that the time has come to dramatically increase military engagement against one another. Israel may believe that the time has come and that it is in their best interest to deal with Iran once and for all, or be forced into that mindset if Iran begins to believe that the time has come and it's in their best interest to deal with Israel once and for all.

Such a war would have enormous consequences on the Middle East. Iran could potentially call Hezbollah in Lebanon, allied forces in Syria, and maybe even Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza to help them in their efforts against Israel. They may even be able to bring other countries in the region into their fold if these countries believe they can win and it's in their best interest to help fight a war against Israel.

On the other hand, Israel would most likely have the support of the US, maybe even some boots on the ground, and maybe they could enlist their new friends UAE and Bahrain into the fold as they also hate Iran and are wary of Iran's influence and power. Who knows, maybe under-the-table friend of Israel when it benefits them, Saudi Arabia, would also join Israel in a war against their arch-nemesis Iran.

Even without third parties, a direct solo war of Israel vs. Iran would still be massive and have huge ramifications on the future of the Middle East and the future of I/P. If Israel were to enter war against Iran, I foresee deep unrest arising from the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinians could seize an opportunity to stymie Israel or make matters worse for Israel as they would be in disarray and focused on the war with Iran. At the very least, if they don't exactly take arms, they could just make things a bit more difficult for Israel. Now imagine what would happen if Hamas and/or PIJ decided to dramatically increase their operations against Israel to support Iran or even directly work with Iran. An already contentious situation in I/P would explode like a powder keg.

I'm not sure Israel could successfully defend itself against Iran while also gaining the tactical victories it wants in a war against Iran while also dealing with maintaining the status quo with Palestine. I'm even much less confident in this if Israel were to have to deal with Hezbollah, Syrian forces, forces in Gaza and the WB, and potentially some other countries. No matter what the circumstances are I think Israel would win such a war, but at what costs and would they be able to move forward in a positive manner after winning the war? I'm not so certain.

What do you guys think will happen with Israel-Iran, either in the near future or in the distant future? Who do you think will be involved? What will be the ramifications of such a war for I/P?

Title: Trump's suggestion for the future of Gaza is Ethnic Cleansing. Even if you are pro-Israel, you should condemn this idea.
Content: First of all - It should be obvious that U.S. support for Israel is not rooted in moral principles or genuine solidarity with the Israeli people, as politicians often claim. Instead, it stems from a long history of American imperialism and a desire for global dominance. The U.S. maintains a close relationship with Israel not just as an ally, but as a means of exerting influence over a nuclear-armed power in a geopolitically critical region.

This strategy is a continuation of the Cold War mentality, where the U.S. sought global influence against the USSR. Today, that same mindset fuels America's presence in the Middle East, aiming to counterbalance Russian and Chinese influence, intimidate Iran, and assert dominance over regional powers like Saudi Arabia.

But regardless of where you stand on Israel, Trump‚Äôs suggestion of forcibly relocating the entire population of Gaza is indefensible. What he is proposing is ethnic cleansing by definition. This rhetoric only adds fuel, and legitimacy, to accusations that Israel is engaging in genocide, financed by U.S. tax dollars. The reality is that the vast majority of those who would be displaced are innocent civilians. Are you really comfortable watching these people, who have already endured immense suffering, be violently stripped of their homes and livelihoods?

Moreover, Hamas still holds hostages. How do you think such a proposal impacts negotiations for their release? What does this mean for any potential ceasefire?

If you believe this forced removal is justified, ask yourself honestly: Is it because you think it is the best solution for humanity? Or is it fueled by hatred for Palestinian people and a desire for revenge over Hamas‚Äôs actions?

There are alternatives. Hamas can be dismantled without ethnically cleansing an entire region, without forcibly displacing millions from their homeland, and without such blatant disregard for human rights and international law. This extreme suggestion is not just immoral and absurd, it is dangerous. It will fuel more resentment toward Israel and the West, likely leading to further violence.

Egypt and Jordan have clearly expressed a refusal to take in 2 million Palestinian refugees. If the U.S. somehow pressures them into doing so, how do you think that will affect overall regional relations? How will it be done safely? How will it impact terrorist organizations seeking to expand their recruitment?

If you believe this is a good idea, I genuinely want to hear why. Explain it to me.

Title: Ismail Haniyeh is dead
Content: Hamas's top political leader Ismail Haniyeh has been killed in Iran at his residence in Tehran, according to Hamas and Iran's Revolutionary Guards. 

In a statement, Hamas said he died in:

>"A treacherous Zionist raid on his residence in Tehran‚Äù

The IRGC said:

>"With condolences to the heroic nation of Palestine and the Islamic nation and the fighters of the resistance front and the noble nation of Iran, this morning \[Wednesday\] the residence of Mr. Dr. Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the political office of the Islamic resistance of Hamas, was hit in Tehran, and following this incident, he and one of his bodyguards was martyred.

>The cause and dimensions of this incident are being investigated and the results will be announced later."

Israel hasn't claimed responsibility or commented (yet). Though far-right Heritage Minister Amichay Eliyahu¬†made some Tweets about it. Musa Abu Marzouk, a senior member of Hamas's political bureau, warned that the elimination of the Haniyeh "will not pass in silence."

This comes after Israel's strikes in Lebanon on Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukr the same day, killing at least three people, two children and a woman and injuring 74 others according to the Lebanese health ministry. The IDF claims Shukr died while some sources from Hezbollah say he survived with injuries. The story on Haniyeh just broke less than an hour or so ago so details are scarce and this is still a developing story. While he was in Iran he had attended the swearing-in ceremony of Iran's new president. Not sure what this means exactly for the war or the already-failing ceasefire talks yet but it's certainly a massive development.

* israel clearly backed the ayotolla & mullahs in their bid to steal our country.. the proof comes from **both** the level of propaganda through the west which enabled it .. western countries were also mad about OPEC so it wasnt hard to convince them .. **and** the fact that israel sold weapons to the islamic regime throughout the Iran/Iraq war

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_in_the_Iran‚ÄìIraq_War

>In early 1980, the first military equipment sale by Israel to the Iranian government of Ayatollah Khomeini occurred, when Israel sold to Iran a large number of tires for the F-4 Phantom fighter jet.[12][13][14][15][16] The net profit from the sale gave rise to an extra-budgetary **Likud party**/intelligence community slush fund, which grew substantial over the next years

notice it was **Likud** Party

heres a WSJ article from 1986 about the CIA knowledge of this

https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00965R000504340006-3.pdf

this shows the sales began directly after the mullahs took over [1979]

https://www.jstor.org/stable/2536816

meanwhile, USA was selling weapons to Sadaam right? i beleive it was because israel wanted Iraq out of the way as part of their eXpansionist plan of "**Eretz Yisrael**" 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Israel


--------

**my hypothesis is that the wildly Anti-Semetic mullahs hated israel even though they bought arms from them and their rhetoric triggerred the formation of the groups like Hez and eventually Hmas**

>Hezbollah was established by Lebanese clerics primarily to fight the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.[14] It adopted the model set out by Ayatollah Khomeini after the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and the party's founders adopted the name "Hezbollah" as chosen by Khomeini.


**HOWEVER, i DO NOT beleive that the islamic state mullahs controlling Iran have the level of control over those 'proxies' and the level of CONTROL is overstates by israel [and zionist america] as part of their ongoing strategy of demonizing the 'Arab' world**

Persians are not culturally Arabs, but we have been caught in the mess due to the wealth of Oil [and Copper] AND due to the general reJection of islam beginning with the Shah's Father who was absolutely BRUTAL against mullahs

**I ALSO BELEIVE that the freedom of Palestinians is directly linked to the Freedom of Iranians from islamic rule.. NO country with an army should be run by a theocracy and the PEOPLE of Iran are begging for change, yet the world leaders do NOTHING to actually help ... every time they call Iran a paraiah state they distance the country from the world and the mullahs have an excuse to tighten the grip**

now, we clearly see the result of a heavily armed and oil rich islamic state who holds power becasue they are seen as one of the ONLY groups to stand up to US imperialism & israeli actions which are calculated to de-stabilize the region

Title: The Jewish exodus from Arab/Muslim countries is not equivalent to the Palestinian Nabka. It is worse
Content: 


(To my knowledge, none of the below-stated facts are controversial. But I will be happy to be educated).



A few points of comparison:



**1.Absolute numbers:**

Roughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from Israel during the 1948 war.

Roughly 1,000,000 Jews fled or were expelled from the Arab world plus Iran and Turkey in the decades that followed.

Additionally, between 30,000 to 90,000 Palestinian refugees managed to return to Israel before it could enforce effective border control. To my knowledge, few or no Jews ever returned to Arab/Muslim countries.

**2. Relative numbers:**

The Palestinian population in Israel was reduced by around 80% because of the Palestinian Nakba.

The Jewish population in most Arab/Muslim countries was reduced by 99% or even 100%.

This is significant because there still exists a vibrant (if oppressed) Palestinian society inside Israel, while the Jewish communities throughout the Arab world (some of them ancient) were completely and permanently obliterated, something not even the Holocaust could do. There are more Jews today living in Poland than in the entire Arab world.



**3. Causes:**

There's no doubt that the Zionists took advantage of the chaos of the 1948 war to reduce the Palestinian population as much as possible. There's also no doubt that there would have been hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees even if the Zionists *were actively trying* to make them stay. Every war in the history of the planet has caused massive refugee crises, and the blame for them usually falls on whoever started the war. It should be noted that there were also tens of thousands of Jewish refugees fleeing the war in the opposite direction, from Gaza and Hebron and Jerusalem into Israel. Again, not a single Jew was allowed to remain in the Arab-controlled territories of Palestine after the war.



The Jewish exodus from Arab countries took place in peacetime. Many Jews immigrated willingly for ideological reasons, but there were also numerous pogroms, expulsions, and various state policies to make life impossible for Jews. All of this could have been easily avoided, if the Arab governments weren't pursuing an active policy of ethnic cleansing. To this day, Jewish presence is either barely tolerated in Arab society, or tolerated not at all. The most extreme Israeli Arab-hater doesn't hold a candle to the Nazi-style antisemitic propaganda regularly consumed and believed in mainstream Arab media.



In short, the 1948 war saw expulsions/flight on both sides, sometimes unintentional, sometimes justified by military necessity, sometimes deliberate ethnic cleansing. Like every war in history.



The subsequent decades-long Jewish expulsion from Arab countries was just pure ethnic cleansing.



**4. Reparations:**



The Palestinian refugee population has received more international aid per capita than any other refugee population in history. Israel has also, in various peace negotiations since 1949, offered to allow some of the refugees to return and to pay out compensation for others.



As far as I know, no reparations or international aid of any kind was paid for the amelioration of the situation of Jewish refugees from Arab countries, and the issue was not even mentioned seriously in any peace negotiations.

(This point is only relevant insofar as Israel is held accountable for the continued disenfranchisement of the descendants of Palestinian refugees in their host countries. If we correctly discuss this issue separately, this point is not relevant.)



**Conclusion**



Even to bring up the Palestinian Nakba without a much heavier focus on the Jewish expulsions is to expose oneself as not interested in facts, or human rights, or correcting historical injustices.




It is, of course, valid for anyone to talk about anything they like and to not talk about anything they like. However, talking about the Nakba without mentioning the Jewish expulsions is bad for the following reasons:

1.	‚Å†The people who are loudest about the Nakba are often the same people who outright deny the Jewish expulsions.

2.	‚Å†In certain contexts, such as summarizing historical grievances and crimes of the Israeli-Arab conflict, or of making specific political demands for the resolution of the conflict, it would be racist and hypocritical to mention only one of these two events.

3.	‚Å†The Nakba, in particular, is often cited as the reason to delegitimize the state of Israel and claim that it should be dismantled, and that any dealings with Israel makes one complicit in the crime of the Nakba. If one is to be morally consistent, they must also apply the same standard to Egypt, Syria, Iran, Yemen, etc. The fact that they don‚Äôt indicates that they do not truly believe that an act of ethnic cleansing makes a country illegitimate.

Title: Iran Strikes an Israeli Hospital
Content: Iran attacked an hospital in Israel according to https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/19/world/middleeast/iran-missile-israel-hospital.html?smid=url-share

The author Adam Rasgon who wrote the article made some implications that doesn't sit right. 

Adam Rasgon https://www.jpost.com/author/adam-rasgon

In the article a paragraph, being quoted unabridged, implies things which I will let you comment. 

"The strike on the hospital highlighted how the fighting is endangering civilians in Israel and Iran. At least 24 people have been killed in Israel by Iranian attacks and at least 224 people have been killed in Iran by Israeli strikes since the war started, according to each government."


The strike highlights how Iran is fighting the war if anything. The fact that civilians have died is besides the point. Why the hospital was striked should be the focal point. Nonetheless civilians being killed is a tragedy of wars, more so if war crimes have been committed.

Why would an author seemingly imply that Israel is at fault for civilians being killed? 

This implied argument is reinforced in a paragraph below. In this paragraph it both clarifies that attacking Hospital facilities is a war crime and asserts that Israel has been "widely condemned" for doing that in Gaza. 

Correct me if I am wrong, but this suggests that Israel have committed war crimes before a legitimate court, internationally established and acknowledged as such, has reached a verdict. There may be justification for such strikes.

Why would the author mention that in the same article instead of more acute and relevant information within the context of Israel-Iran.

What do you think about an author making up things about the law? Is he even qualified to make such assessments on war crimes? Shouldn't he at least mention reasons for justification in a legal context?

How do you interpret this article?

EDIT: I will quote the paragraph mentioned for the sake of clarity to engage with the article. 

"Responding to the hospital strike, the Israeli defense minister, Israel Katz, said Iran was committing ‚Äúwar crimes.‚Äù Under international law, it is forbidden to target medical facilities except in rare cases. During the war in Gaza, Israel has been widely condemned for repeatedly raiding and damaging health facilities that it says are used by militants." 

This is apple and pears. The second sentence doesn't sit right. It's outside the point being discussed. It is either lazy or convuluted.

Title: I feel like such an idiot for supporting Palestinians
Content: Ok so I learned about Palestine in May 2021, and found it to be an obvious choice to support the Palestinians, who seemed to be oppressed. In fact, as an Iranian, I saw many parallels between their situation & that of the Iranian people. 

Fast forward to 2022, when the woman life freedom uprisings occurred. I had to unfollow every last pro-Palestine page because they either spread pro regime propaganda, or re-told the history, or made up some other egregious lies. Under every post about Iran, the main people speaking against us were Palestinians & their supporters. 

Even then, when the pro-Palestine movement started ‚Äútrending‚Äù in October, I stood with the Palestinians. I attended protests, I made posts, followed all the pro-Palestine people I could find, & supported the movement. It was precisely this that made me discover an EXTENSIVE network of Islamic republic organizations propelling & fueling the protests, movements, & actions for Palestine. I noticed that the people I was marching & working alongside where proud regime supporters. When they found out my views, some would ostracize me, & others would tone down their views ‚Äî in a, ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt tell you we support the regime so you still help us get where we want, but we will be supporting your oppressors at every step of the way‚Äù type of way. 

I think my wake up call was coming around December, when people were proudly supporting the Houthis. Houthis have a much more direct connection to the Islamic republic than Hamas does (or at least I believe so), so that was a huge red flag. It got worse and worse. Support for Hezbollah, support for IRGC, & so on.

That‚Äôs when I realized how much of an idiot I‚Äôd been. I was getting my news on Palestine from regime organizations (which are NEVER to be believed), I was following regime-backed organizations, & I was in solidarity with literal regime supporters. 

Yes, war crimes & human rights violations are occurring & they must be stopped. However, I believe there are two pro-Palestine movements. One is rooted in genuine human rights & justice & peace in Israel-Palestine, the other one is the Islamic republic‚Äôs ideology. The latter has gone mainstream. And just like the regime destroyed Syria, & Lebanon, & Yemen, this ‚Äúpro Palestine‚Äù movement, led by Hamas, is how they‚Äôre destroying Palestine and putting it on a path they cannot come back from. But unfortunately, I don‚Äôt see any considerable awareness of this among Palestinians or their allies. There are some voices, yes, but they‚Äôre the ones pushed to the margins & ostracized. When the time comes for real change in Palestine, it is the radicals, the terrorists, & the unethical people who will take power, enabled by the ignorance of the well-intentioned public. Reminds me of 1979 in Iran. 

Knowing what I know now, I‚Äôm so deeply resentful when I see a Palestine supporter, or people who naively join the cause. They have no idea what they‚Äôre actually supporting. And those of us who try to point it out are harassed & bullied into silence. 

Edit: adding this ‚Äî a lot of Americans joined the cause over the last 9 months. I generally had high hopes for them, thinking they‚Äôre motivated by human rights. So I‚Äôd tell them about Iran. I‚Äôd talk of the gender apartheid, how they assassinate & kidnap dissidents abroad, how they‚Äôve destroyed Syria, the fact that Hezbollah & Assad regularly bomb Yarmouk, one of the largest Palestinian refugee camps in the world located in Syria. For all their stories about ‚Äúcollective liberation,‚Äù how we can all be ‚Äúfree,‚Äù how we should ‚Äúeducate ourselves about the world,‚Äù I thought they‚Äôd care. I thought they‚Äôd be outraged. That they‚Äôd extend solidarity. That of the 25 infographics they posted every day (most of which were egregious propaganda), they‚Äôd find it in themselves to share even 1 post about Iran, or Syria, or add this context into discussions of a region they‚Äôd discovered only months prior. But it was crickets. They were unmoved. They didn‚Äôt care. In fact, they posted in FAVOUR of Hezbollah. They defended the regime. They said, ‚Äústill though, the west sucks for opposing them.‚Äù And that‚Äôs when I realized that supporting these people and their movement defies all logic. I mean, it‚Äôs Islamic republic-backed & influenced, it treats us Iranians as its ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù (or frankly anyone they don‚Äôt view as ‚Äúoppressed by the west‚Äù), & it will create a world extremely, extremely worse than today. Why on earth would I get behind that when I know better? 

Edit 2: just because you refuse to believe that not everyone follows your narrow worldview, that people change their minds, & that pro-regime sentiments is a core feature of this movement, doesn‚Äôt make it all ‚Äúgo away‚Äù or make me hasbara/a bot. But I think you perfectly prove the issue I‚Äôm illustrating, so thank you for that!

Title: Netanyahu is alienating Israel from the rest of the world, what's your opinion on this?
Content: It seems clear the world is turning more and more against Israel lately. What started as full support for Israel has turned into more and more condemnation from around the world   

Besides the usual condemnation from arab leaders, from countries like Ireland, and even beyond the ICC giving out arrest warrants on Netanyahu and other Israeli & Hamas leaders. Now there's growing condemnation from countries like France with Macron speaking out more and more against Netanyahu, even from Pope Francis who has long accused the Israeli government of stopping aid and bombing children and even denying christians access to their holy sites.     

Most notably though, it seems Trump is growing tired of Netanyahu's war mongering. He had a deal with the Houthis independently from Israel, he started talks with Iran without Israel's knowledge initially even though Netanyahu has long campaigned for the US to not negotiate but rather use direct military strength on Iran. He also had a US hostage released from Hamas with talks with the group without Israel being considered. They even publicly spoke how Netanyahu is not working enough to get the hostages out.   

There's netanyahu's extreme warmongering in Syria that was totally unprovoked despite Sharaa repeatedly stating they do not want war with Israel. Netanyahu even didn't want sanctions on Syria to be lifted.    

All of Netanyahu's demands are contradicting Trump's policy in the middle east where he wants the Abraham Accords to move through, but they won't move through with Netanyahu constantly campaigning for increasing aggression and more military might.    

You can see with the recent state visits by Trump to the gulf countries where he stated they're his strongest allies in the middle east and even in the world. It's clear Netanyahu is being sidelined.    

All of this further alienates Israel from the rest of the world. What used to be seen as an unshakeable alliance and a blank check to do anything and to use up US taxpayer money as much as possible, is now on shakey ground    

Edit: People are again conflating anti-israel sentiment with antisemitism. This also harms the israeli cause because any criticism of the Israeli government gets instantly shot down as anti-semitism even though it's not

Title: The accusations that Israel has committed terrorist attack against population of Lebanon are laughable.
Content: The accusations that Israel "has committed a terrorist attack against the population of Lebanon" are laughable.
The attack was SURGICAL against the Hezbollah terrorists.
I explain to you why the Lebanese civilian population was NOT affected.

The point here is that anti-Israeli propaganda wants to convince us that the attack consisted of randomly "exploding" communication devices and, therefore, there could not have been precise control. The victims would have been random, according to this logic.

here are two serious problems with this idea.
One, which assumes that Israel works magic and can make ALL communication devices of a certain type explode just like that.
No way. That only happens in cartoons.

To make the explosion possible, Israel first INFILTRATED Hezbollah's supply chains, and then arranged for the devices to be tampered with (and this happened in Iran, where they were opened, the explosive was placed, and then closed again).

In addition, they were also given a kind of "fingerprint" so that they could be traced by the Israeli army. And today they were given a "call" (meaning that Israel had the precise data on how to contact them). In other words, Israel knew who it was attacking.

But the other reason is even funnier: assuming that this was an indiscriminate attack in which many Lebanese civilians were killed at random, also implies assuming that, in 2024, in Lebanon they still communicate with beepers (or whatever each country calls them).

This is communication technology from the 80s and 90s. Believe it or not, today's Lebanese are ordinary people who communicate via cell phones. Pagers have been limited in their use to very select and limited groups.

That was the reason Hezbollah decided to replace cell phones with pagers. It thought that this way there was no risk of Israel hacking encrypted communications. And it was right on that level, but it didn't count on Israel coming up with a good alternative with pagers.

But anti-Israeli logic is unable to assimilate this.

Anti Israelis says that the people standing next to the beeper bearers were injured, but the video clearly shows that they were not. The magnitude of the explosions did not cause any harm to the two people standing nearby.
Therefore, the victims were THOSE WHO HAD A BEEPER.

Do doctors in Lebanon have pagers? Maybe, but there is another thing: in NONE of the videos that have circulated of victims arriving at the hospital, can any doctor be seen. Logically, many of them should have arrived wounded, still in their work clothes. But no.

Finally, for ALL beeper users to be injured, Israel would have had to have detonated ALL the beepers. I repeat: if it is not magic.
The special shipment for Hezbollah, purchased in Taiwan and altered in Iran, was detonated.

Oh, yes. It was also reported that a 10-year-old girl had died. Of course, because in Lebanon 10-year-old girls communicate with pagers.
It's up to you if you want to believe them. It would just be a desire to be an idiot.
This operation was surgically precise.

Hezbollah, for its part, must be less than heart-stopping. If Israel has already gotten into them up to that point (the little device you usually put next to one of your testicles), how far has it not already gotten into them?

Title: ‚ÄúIsrael: The Most Incompetent Genociders in History‚Äù
Content: 
If you listen to the UN, activist groups, or Twitter mobs, Israel has apparently been committing genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza for decades. Yet somehow‚Ä¶

Gaza‚Äôs population grew from 350,000 in 1967 to 2.2 million in 2023

Meanwhile, world Jewish population is still lower than it was in 1936 (16.6M ‚Üí 16.1M)

Some ‚Äúgenocide.‚Äù

If the IDF is trying to wipe out Palestinians, they‚Äôre the most ineffective genociders in world history.

‚∏ª

Meanwhile, Real Genocides Happen, and the UN Barely Noticed

Let‚Äôs talk about actual mass atrocities and how the world responded.

Syria

500,000+ civilians killed. Cities flattened. Chemical weapons used.
UN response: Some hand-wringing, no obsession.

China

1 million Uyghurs detained in forced labor and re-education camps.
UNGA resolutions: Zero.

Iran

Gays publicly executed, women beaten for protesting.
UN Women‚Äôs Rights Council seat? Yes.

Russia

Invades Ukraine, abducts children, flattens cities.
UNGA resolutions in 2022: 6
Israel resolutions that same year: 15

Saudi Arabia

Slaughters civilians in Yemen, dismembers a journalist.
UN outrage: MIA.

And Turkey still denies the Armenian Genocide ever happened. Crickets from the ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù crowd.

‚∏ª

UN: 154 Resolutions Against Israel, 71 for the Rest of the World

Between 2015‚Äì2023:

154 UNGA resolutions condemned Israel

Only 71 were directed at every other country combined

Not a typo. Israel, 0.1% of the world‚Äôs population, gets the majority of the UN‚Äôs moral scolding.

And Hamas? The terror group that murders civilians and uses children as shields?

Zero UNGA resolutions. Ever.

This isn‚Äôt justice. It‚Äôs obsession. It‚Äôs scapegoating. It‚Äôs antisemitism in a suit and tie.

‚∏ª

‚ÄúEthnic Cleansing‚Äù While Population Grows?

Ethnic cleansing usually means‚Ä¶ the population goes down. Not up sixfold.

If Israel truly wanted to ‚Äúwipe out‚Äù Palestinians, Gaza wouldn‚Äôt have one of the highest population densities and growth rates on Earth.

Meanwhile, Jewish population globally is still recovering from the actual genocide committed against them. But Israel‚Äôs existence? That‚Äôs what enrages the UN.

‚∏ª

This Isn‚Äôt About Palestinians. It‚Äôs About Jews.

There are 22 Arab countries. Over 50 Muslim nations. And one Jewish state.

Every peace deal Israel ever offered, 2000, 2008, 2014, even under Trump‚Äôs Abraham Accords, was rejected by Palestinian leaders. Not because the terms weren‚Äôt good. Because accepting peace means accepting Israel‚Äôs right to exist.

That‚Äôs the heart of it.

‚∏ª

Conclusion: The Mask Is Off

This isn‚Äôt about Gaza. It‚Äôs not about occupation, settlements, or blockades. It‚Äôs about Jewish sovereignty.

If this were about human rights, the UN wouldn‚Äôt ignore China, Syria, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. It wouldn‚Äôt obsessively attack the only liberal democracy in the Middle East while giving brutal regimes a free pass.

So no, Israel isn‚Äôt committing genocide. But the people pushing that lie? They‚Äôre complicit in something older and uglier than they realize.

Worst genocide ever? No.
Worst smear campaign ever? Absolutely.

Title: Iran behind recent terror wave in Israel
Content: According to the Jerusalem Post, Iranian funding, and the proliferation of weapons under the Iranian directive is believed to be the reason for the uptick in terror in Israel.

A large explosive device that targeted IDF soldiers near Nablus on Wednesday night has the hallmarks of the Iran-backed terror campaign that has continued to percolate and grow this year. Over the past year, Iran has increasingly sought to expand the number of fronts against Israel. This means inflaming the West Bank as well as encouraging Hezbollah to increase tensions.

This week, there has been focus on Lebanon and Hezbollah‚Äôs increasing provocations, as well as an Iranian focus on Syria where it wants US forces to leave the country. All this comes during a rising wave of terror attacks against Israel this week.

The explosion in Nablus appears similar to other attempts by Palestinian Islamic Jihad to use explosives against the IDF and Israel. For instance during the operations in Jenin earlier this summer PIJ attempted to festoon the city with IEDs and other weapons. The goal is to ambush the IDF and destroy vehicles and get soldiers bogged down. In this regard, Iran‚Äôs backing of terror groups in the region by providing technical know-how on IEDs and other weapons has been a key factor in backing groups like PIJ, Hezbollah and also threats to US forces in Syria and US forces in Iraq in the past.
The context of Iran‚Äôs threats also extends into other areas of Israel. Hezbollah enabled an infiltration that targeted a junction near Megiddo earlier this year, while Palestinian groups worked on simple designs for missiles in the West Bank.

In recent weeks, Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah threatened Israel several times. There is a significant change that is taking place on the ground in the West Bank, Jerusalem has said recently. It is related to Iranian funding, and to the proliferation of weapons under the Iranian directive. ‚ÄúIran seeks every means to harm the citizens of Israel,‚Äù said Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.

Last week, reports indicated that criminals in Lod and Kafr Kassem were accused of trying to bring explosives into Israel and this was linked to Hezbollah. In addition, it was revealed that Iran was linked to the smuggling attempt at Ashdot Yaakov in July. Walla also had a recent article claiming that IDF jeeps are vulnerable to Iranian-IEDs. This is all linked to the recent explosion in Nablus and the attempts by terror groups linked to Iran to set the West Bank alight before the High Holy Days in Israel.

As such, so long as the Palestinians continue to align themselves with and receive backing from one of the greatest threats to international stability - Iran - (who is assisting Russia in Ukraine by way) they cannot and should not under any circumstances have any right to govern themselves. Nor should they be allowed to become Israeli citizens. Their leadership factions are a menace to regional stability, and it is insulting to call them freedom fighters. Until the Palestinian people rise up against them in the name of peace with Israel, there should be no negotiations whatsoever.

Title: Lets be honest: Israel shouldn't listen to the International Community and foreigners
Content: Let's be honest: Israel shouldn't listen to the International Community and foreigners or Progressives who want Israel to be some type of a moral dream/reflection of Universal values and think they know Israel's interest better than Israel.

Israel shouldn‚Äôt take moral lectures from the International Community, foreign governments, or Western Progressives who believe Israel exists to reflect their fantasies of universal values. These people treat Israel like it‚Äôs a graduate school ethics project, not a real country with real enemies. They think they know Israel‚Äôs interests better than the people who live under rocket fire and send their kids to the army. Spoiler: they don‚Äôt.

The same people who applauded Oslo, cheered for disengagement from Gaza, and kept insisting that peace was just one more concession away ‚Äî they‚Äôve been wrong every time. The result? Terror, war, and the emboldening of enemies who take compromise as weakness. Progressives and diplomats abroad demand that Israel act like Sweden while surrounded by groups who operate more like ISIS. It's delusional.

These critics want Israel to be better than any other country ‚Äî not just morally better, but suicidally self-sacrificing. When Israelis are killed, they say ‚Äúde-escalate.‚Äù When Israel fights Jihad and protects its citizens, they say ‚Äúproportionality.‚Äù Their vision for Israel is a punching bag with nice manners.

And the idea that this crowd is motivated by some higher ethics? Please. The same UN that obsesses over Israel shrugs at genocide elsewhere. The same Western activists who scream about Gaza ignore Syria, Yemen, Iran. This isn‚Äôt about values ‚Äî it‚Äôs about using Israel as a projection screen for their own politics, guilt, and fantasies.

That doesn‚Äôt mean the Israeli right is above criticism. It‚Äôs not. There‚Äôs a lot of noise, dysfunction, and self-dealing at home too. But no serious country hands over its national security strategy to outsiders who‚Äôve proven, time and again, that they‚Äôre clueless at best and hostile at worst.

Oslo Accords, a darling project of the international diplomats and the democratic party. Israel was assured that giving the PLO a foothold would lead to peace. Oslo handed weapons, legitimacy, and territory to terrorists who never abandoned their goal of Jihad. It brought bus bombings, mass shootings, the Second Intifada

And then there‚Äôs Gaza - the grand mistake of a gesture of withdrawal that was supposed to ‚Äúopen the door to peace‚Äù and ‚Äústrengthen moderates.‚Äù The disengagement still symbolizes for these people "the old Israel", ignoring that this movie was a mistake and Israel shouldn't have done it and shouldn't have compromised. Only a fool steps into the same fire twice - unless you‚Äôre a UN diplomat or a progressive academic, apparently.

Israel exists to protect its citizens and its national interests, not to impress Western academics, "Liberal" Jews like Peter Beinart, J-Street and Thomas Friedman, NGOs, or op-ed writers. It doesn‚Äôt owe moral theater. When Israel compromises, it gets murdered.

Title: I hate being called a devil for existing.
Content: I'm a soldier in the IDF.
I don't hold a gun, and I'm not in intelligence, just a network engineer for non essential systems on the home front command.

For the past few weeks my phone has been getting blown up by anti israel, anti zionist, pro palestinian media coverage, messages and threats for unkown reasons.

I was born in israel, so did my father, so did his father, so did his father and so did his father.
We don't know past that, but it likely goes back further, back to the days of the ottomen empire.
On my mother side, my grandparents were born in persia, modern day Iran, and had to flee because they were jewish.

I don't understand how someone can tell me I deserve to die for wanting to live here.
People keep telling me israel is america's doggy, and we steal US aid, but US aid accounts for less than 3% of israel's annual GDP.
People keep telling me that israel is an apartheid state, while I can't get accepted to medical school and they can with no SAT or even a high school diploma, while I need an almost perfect score on both.
They also get scholarships I can't get and more advanced healthcare than I get for free.

Most israeli arabs I see drive mercedes or skoda cars and wear luxury watches.

How can people tell me that I am an opressor? A colonizer?

It's driving me crazy that just because I was born here I am destined to be hated by the world.

Yeah israel is not perfect, and you cannot 100% justify what we are doing in gaza, but you also can't say there is no reason and that it's blindless genocide, because it is not.
There is a pretty famous recording from october 7th, where a hamas member calls his father and excitedly tells him he killed 10 jews. The israelis framed this as a horrific war crime and as something unspeakable, which it is.
Sadly, a few weeks later, I heard from an IDF soldier who was in gaza: Damn I shot a dude that's cool, maybe killed him.

This is not acceptable from both sides.
War is not fun. War is not wanted.
I don't know a single person who wanted this war to start.

It's just.. really frustrating that I am no longer allowed to talk in my language abroad without getting beaten, or talk about my country proudly online.
I can't even mention where I am from when talking online or I will get death threats and chants.

People tell me to go to new york, why?
I have never been in new york, I don't have family in new york, I'm not connected to new york, I don't have a visa, or a green card, or an esta.
Why am I supposed to go to new york then?

This land is my home, just as it is the arabs home, and the arabs who live here, who represent 20% of the population, have it pretty well.

Just a rant.

Content: Last night in amsterdam, was supposed to be a normal night with a football(for fellow americans - soccer) match between the local team - ajax, to a guest team from abroad, the thing is - the other team was Israeli. As soon as the game ended and Israeli fans took their way back to the hotel, they were ambushed by a mass of (mostly) arab pro palestinians that attacked, robbed and actually hunted them when they tried to flee.

Now, amsterdam is a city that is known to have occasional fights between football fans, who are usually described as "hooligans".

But even by local media it is recognised that yesterday was not a hooligan riot, but an ideological one, with one side being Israeli football fans, who came to support their team and the other an organised mass of people carrying palestinian flags (in spite of palestine having nothing to do with this football match) with only one intention, violence against israelis and jews.
This incident echoes a certain period of time from the last century, that came to it's peak during WW2.

I still hear many people saying that the jews should return to europe because that's where they came from (which isn't true, they were always known to be outsiders in europe, you can also see similar treatment to other groups, such as the romani people), last night showed exactly what's waiting for jews there, they are not acting as victims, they are truly terrified to return and live in a continent that systematically murdered and expelled them.

Most of the attackers yesterday were refugees themselves, who escaped similar treatment in their countries, and are now turning the places they came to to be exactly like the places they once escaped.
How will incidents like this help ending the conflict?

I often hear from palestine supporters that Israel always plays the victim, but I can really see why Israelis feel like it, no matter what jews do or say, they are always to blame.

Oct 7th was their fault.
The war with hezbollah and lebanon was their fault.
The houthi attacks on the red sea is their fault.
The middle east cold war with iran is their fault.
The taking of jewish students hostages and ostracizing them from international and ivy league universities is their fault.
Hell, even their expultion from arab states and the genocide commited on them in europe is their fault.
Their mere existence in any region is their sin, and they have no way to escape their fates.

Then people actually wonder why jews are being over protective, as well as feel like victims, there is just can't win the public opinion, they are not welcome anywhere, not even in their own 76 year old state, where they tried multiple times to achieve peace with the arab population, even managing to come to terms with neiboughring hostile states, it's still their fault.

It saddens me to see the world didn't actually progress that much, and that violence comes with the disguise of liberty, equality and self determination, just not for the jews. 

**update**
many of you didn't understand me, I didn't say there were no Israeli hooligans, but the attackers were'nt even in the game itself, they waited and stalked the fans on their way to the stadium until they were stopped by the police, on the way some of the fans (the fans come in different groups and not in an homogonized way) started acting in a racist way, howeve, in light of the past year antisemetic incidents,  and overall vandalism in pro palestinian riots it wouldn't surprise me that a few mugheaded fans would get angry (not that it is justified, but the argument of "fans acting poorly" to justify the attacks doesn't really cut it, especially because it's very two sided ).

anyway - this attack was co-ordinated, organised and was directed at israelis and jews, and anyone who dared having any jewish symbol or identifier on them, there were also local dutch people and other tourists who got beat up for trying to stop the fighting. The attackers waited outside of the stadium area and started following the maccabi fans (wether hooligans or just football fans coming to support their favorite  team) and attacking them in a hit and run tactic, also stealing their bags, wallets and passports, actively searching for israeli and jews to beat up.

The attack was also planned on telegram before the incidents with the maccabi fans even occured, as for the Israeli troop, it is correct that there was an idf soldier in the israeli crowd, but that doesn't give anyone a right to lynch him.

If you still justify this unnecessary violence, congragulations, you are exactly the type of person this post is about, and have no regard or care for the jewish people, and you are presnting your case in a very one sided way, not giving the jews any remorsefull chance of building themselves better lives than this circle of violence, which forces them to allways be in a state of survival, which you call "victimizing"

Title: Anyone Who Thinks People Care About Israeli Deaths
Content: First, do not go and reply or participate in this thread. No reason to brigade or get yourself banned arguing with people who you will never convince Israeli lives have value.

https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldNewsHeadlines/comments/1lar8dt/tel_aviv_under_attack/

https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldNewsHeadlines/comments/1lbmvx2/tel_aviv/

Just one of many posts showing people celebrating Israeli deaths, they have zero empathy, or they deserved it.

"Don't get me wrong, i don't cry for zionist deaths, each zionist less in this planet makes for a better planet, but it just shows you how fucking insane it is, that they don't even care about the in group. They just want death and destruction"

Just straight up saying the world is a better place when Israelis die because they're Zionists. Incredible.

"Absolutely! Iran‚Äîa real, legitimate non-occupation state‚Äîhas the right to defend itself against attacks from a genocidal white-supremacist settler regime!"

Self explanatory, just the level of delusion people have. Either they are outright lying or propaganda has severely compromised people's ability to think.

"I don‚Äôt feel bad for these people one little bit."

And in reply 

"Im so relieved that Israel poked the bear and woke it up."

None of this is surprising and I know a lot of you already know it's everywhere, but for the people that deny the celebration of Israeli deaths, or that say no one wants Israel to be destroyed, no one wants Israeli civilians to be killed, here's a whole thread filled to the brim. There's many more threads like this, and you're not going to be able to stop them, but at least be aware that this is out there. That anyone who denies people think this way are either liars or willfully ignorant.

I'm sure most of the replies here will be defending it because they always do. But don't let them try and excuse this behavior, because if it was Jews or Israelies saying these things it would be blasted to every corner. Don't let anyone tell you there aren't a large portion of people celebrating and justifying Israeli deaths. And don't stoop to their level, just let them show their true selves and what they represent.

Title: Can we just get real and say unless/until Palestinians reject terrorism, we will never get anywhere?
Content: It‚Äôs not overly complicated, nuanced or layered. In reality it‚Äôs pretty cut and dry. Until Palestinians accept Israel exists and drop terrorism or the idea Israel is going away or can be destroyed, we will be in a cycle of never-ending violence. Israel, in battling to remove Hamas, spilling their own blood doing so, is doing the world and Palestinians one of the biggest favors they could ever do, and something Palestinians themselves should be doing. But the Palestinians dug themselves into the hole of unending hatred and perpetual, generational violence. If Palestinians finally accept that Israel isn‚Äôt going anywhere, and decided to care more about their own affairs than eliminating Israel, they would probably make progress toward having something like a functioning state. If ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù became a state with its current leadership, it would resemble something like the theocratic autocracy in Iran, at best, and likely would be even worse/more violent and repressive. If Palestinians let go of hatred, they could walk down the path of peace with Israel as a willing partner. Israel does not want any wars with its neighbors and is now in a war brought upon it by Hamas setting up a terror state next door, complete with hundreds of kilometers of underground tunnels paid for by UN money provided by the US and Europe. So if the ‚Äúpro Palestine‚Äù crowd could actually direct their efforts toward putting Hamas on blast instead of running interference for a literal terror group, it would at least ensure you aren‚Äôt wasting your time simply looking stupid and being hateful in public. And it would go a very long way to getting to the heart of the matter which is we will never get anywhere so long as Palestinians choose annihilation instead of dealing with coexistence. 

Edit: wow - this thread generated a lot of discussion and responses. I wish I had time to respond to everyone who wrote in, I will if I have the time. I find it very interesting that the basic premise - Palestinians should reject terrorism to break the cycle of violence we are currently in - people can take and say ‚Äúwhat about ISRAEL? What about settlements? WHAT ABOUT‚Ä¶‚Äù - well, yeah, what about it? The deflection begins immediately without addressing the basic question: do Palestinians need to abandon terrorist attacks and accept the existence of Israel for there to be a lasting peace? You‚Äôre either for terrorism as a justifiable tactic (including in the case of Hamas: rape, murder, torture and kidnapping of civilians) or you‚Äôre not. It seems like many people on the ‚Äúpro Palestine‚Äù side are therefore either A) in favor of terrorism or B) extremely useful idiots for people who are. I see the Palestinian use of terrorism as leading to nothing but ruin. The fact that condemning deliberate terrorism against civilians involves any kind of equivocation means we are at a dark point. 

Finally - may all the hostages be released as soon as possible.

Title: Iran‚Äôs Nuclear Program to Be Stopped This Weekend
Content: **Today ‚Äì coincidentally Friday the 13th ‚Äì there are very strong indications that Israel will, at long last, stop Iran‚Äôs nuclear program this weekend. The US announcement that it will withdraw its diplomats from Iraq and allow military families to voluntarily leave the Gulf states seems to point to an imminent attack on Iran. International news agencies have also reported, citing various sources, that Israel was considering launching an attack on Iran within days.**  **The first wave was launched today 3 am.**

For years, I have predicted that an Israeli attack on Iran‚Äôs nuclear weapons program is imminent, but a decisive attack has not occurred. My assessment is based on the so-called <6 month time window, meaning that Israel, either alone or with US support, will stop Iran‚Äôs nuclear weapons program about six months before a nuclear bomb is ready. For years, either diplomatic or military solutions have managed to keep the threat outside the time window.

From Israel‚Äôs perspective, a decisive attack on Iran would cut off the head of the  snake, i.e. the source of the ‚Äúring of fire‚Äù surrounding Iran. The Houthis are part of Iran‚Äôs proxy armies and have continuously attacked Israel with ballistic missiles. An attack on Iran could cut off Iranian missile deliveries to Yemen. In addition, the Houthis are said to be about to attack Israel with new weapons, including missiles equipped with ‚Äúcluster warheads.‚Äù

Title: Worst night in Israel since 7.10 thoughts as an israeli
Content: I've never written two posts on here so close to one another, and I don't know if this should be tagged as news or discussion or what, but I think it could be interesting for people to know what the Iranian attacks were like for Israelis.

As I start every post: I am a 17 year old girl from Tel Aviv, I was protesting for Palestinian rights since I was five. I am neither "pro Palestine" or "pro Israel"

For about a week or two, there were rumours and buzzes about an Iran attack that is coming soon. Both on the news, and general panic in Israeli social media. I've dismissed it and convinced myself that their tactic is to scare us thru Iranian bots and that no attack is going to happen. For context, I've never lived during an attack from a force other then Hammas and their made-in-china rockets.

Yesterday I was on my way to a friend's birthday in central Tel Aviv,  on my way there my friend started texting me saying she is worried because of things she sees on tiktok. I told her to not believe anything she sees there, and there's no Iranian attack coming. Not even 15 minutes later the government releases a message that school is cancelled tomorrow (which there was already none of, because of Passover. So it was basically a message saying "some bad-shittery is about to go down tomorrow"). I was starting to stress out but I still went to celebrate the birthday. Around 10pm one of the people in the birthday gets up and whispers in the birthday girl's ear "some fireworks are about to go off in an hour" which meant there are rumours that rockets are about to shoot. 

We all decided that if Iran drops an atom bomb and we're all gonna die, were at least going to get fucked up tonight and continued drinking and having fun. But everyone started stressing more and more, and one couple decided they rather go home, near a bomb shelter. We wanted to keep the party going so we paid and decided to go to one of the guys house and keep drinking there. Five guys went by car and me and the birthday girl went by bus. Before we even managed to reach the bus station we get a call from the guys (which are also IDF soldiers) all they said was "don't come. It's going to be a rough night, get some sleep". We got really stressed and decided to go to my house.

On the bus a ticket guy started checking tickets and an old lady started yelling "we are going to die! And you are worried about tickets?? Shame on you!" Then we got off and got to my house. In my house the news were open on the TV, which is rare in my house, and my mom was packing a big bag in case we will need to stay in the bomb shelter for a long time. We started watching the news, and suddenly, they were off. They said the war planes are on their way to us. They started by saying we have seven hours until they reach. We all sat in silence in front of the news, watched the hours go down. Six hours, five hours, three hours, half an hour. Ten minutes. They said they were sending ballistic rockets too. They started reaching the north, then the south, then everywhere. Admittedly they didn't reach Tel Aviv. We stayed up all night watching the iron dome blow up the rockets and the planes.
Jordan, USA, Britain and maybe Iraq also stopped the planes and rockets
 And finally went to sleep for an hour in 5am. Woke up to see the news, Iran said they won't attack again if Israel won't attack back, but of course our kindergarten of a government will attack back. The next days are not going to be calm, I'm safe, one Israeli Muslim kid died from the rockets, 32 went to the hospital from aggressive anxiety attacks. Pray for us.

Title: What is "Free Palestine"?
Content: This is not a sarcastic question. 

What I am asking for are the practical, concrete steps and conditions that would satisfy the calls for "Free Palestine". This sub already has lots of moralizing and long history lessons. I am asking for specifics. 

I would also hope for answers that consider the ramifications of their proposals. For example, if Free Palestine means the immediate withdrawal of all Israeli forces and control from Gaza and the West Bank, the dismantling of all settlements, and the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state, then what is Israel entitled to do when it is inevitably attacked? (This is a fair assumption as at least 35-40% of Palestinians do not favor 2 states, and Iran certainly does not).

If your proposal is one state, do you expect Israel to give up its Jewish identity? If you acknowledge that will never happen, what should Palestinians do, keep fighting? If Jews are mistreated in this new state, are they entitled to engage in violent resistance?

Title: IDF says Hezbollah terror chief Hassan Nasrallah was killed in Beirut strike
Content: The IDF announces that Hezbollah terror chief Hassan Nasrallah was killed in yesterday‚Äôs airstrike in Beirut.  
  
Link to Times of Israel article [here](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-september-28-2024/).

After a year of bombardment from Hezbollah, triggered by Hamas' massacre of Israelis on the 7th of October, Israel is fighting back in Lebanon.

So far, over 250 Israeli hostages were taken, and over 1700 Israelis dead, the majority civilian. More than 20 thousand rockets have been fired at Israel from Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, and Yemen.

Last night, Israel took out the leader of the largest terror organization (or call it "non-state military" if you find "terror" to be a loaded term). This follows successful strikes against a large amount of Hezbollah leadership, and an audacious operation that culminated in the explosion of thousands of pagers and walkie talkies held by Hezbollah operatives.

What do you believe is next? Will Israel mount a ground invasion? What will Hezbollah, and even Iran's response look like?

Title: The insanity of the pro-Iran position regarding nuclear capability.
Content: I mean, I‚Äôm seriously starting to lose faith in humanity. How can anyone seriously believe that Iran possessing nuclear capabilities is a GOOD thing???

It‚Äôs the equivalent of being pro North Korea nukes. Yeah, give the authoritarian dictatorship that is isolated from the world the ability to kill millions of people if the regime feels it‚Äôs backed into a corner!

Not to mention the Saudi prince is on record stating that if Iran was to possess nuclear arms capability Saudi Arabia would follow suit. Like as in the position pro-Iran people are taking is that an unstable war torn Middle East should begin a nuclear arms race???

And then in order to further be pro-Iran here, you have to concede that a large majority of Iranians heavily dislike their theocracy and its political overreach, and favor regime change. So you then have to concede you are not even pro-Iranian people, just its psycho government and minority of supporters, who are prone to terrorism and extreme authoritarianism, silencing political dissent and un-Islamic opinion since 1979.

Like as in you mean to tell me that the position people are willing to defend is ‚Äúlet‚Äôs let another psychopathic regime acquire nuclear arms capability, because Putin and Kim Jong un weren‚Äôt enough!‚Äù 

Also, anybody who is taking a middle of the road approach here like ‚ÄúIran was in the middle of negotiations‚Äù and ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs actions cause civilian harm‚Äù are not really realizing the extent of Iranian nuclear capability‚Äôs impact. Every single middle eastern country, maybe even India, would feel the threatening effects of such a capability, but obviously first and foremost Israel. The level of geopolitical chaos that could ensue from Iranian nuclear capability far outweigh, in terms of magnitude of threat and effect, any short term conflict that has since occurred due to Israel‚Äôs operation.

Title: To the Israel is committing genocide crowd
Content: The Israeli army has proven it is strong, it is well informed, and it is clever. Targeted attacks on Iran into single apartment units.  Hacked Hezbollahs pagers and made them explode. Intercepted thousands of missiles launched at them with incredible success.  They have taken out Hamas, Hezbollah, much of the Houthis, Assad, and soon to be the Iranians. 

There are 50,000 dead Palestinians without distinguishing combatants and civilians, which is of course a critical distinction. It is horribly tragic for the innocent civilians who have become casualties of the realities of a war fought underneath the commonplaces those civilians gathered. Still, data estimates that Palestine‚Äôs population GREW by 1.97% last year (source below). Even if there‚Äôs another source of data, it isn‚Äôt going to be drastically different. And given the difficulty getting accurate data on this, I‚Äôm not sure how you could prove that whatever source you find is more objective than the one I‚Äôm using. 

With all of the above in mind, I‚Äôll pose to you the question ‚Äî Given that the IDF has proven its superior strength, don‚Äôt you think they would have killed a lot more than 50,000 people over 619 days? If they really wanted to kill civilians and commit a genocide, they‚Äôre doing a pretty poor job for an incredibly strong military. 

They want their people back and they want peace. They are a democracy. They are flawed, no doubt. Every country is. Still - people of all religions, sexualities, races, cultures all live as equals there, they have a strong economy, they invent things for the world, and they‚Äôre fighting off the enemies of western civilization one by one. This should not be this hard. It‚Äôs not too late to switch sides.

Title: Do you think the Islamic Republic is going to start whining about being oppressed and genocided soon?
Content: I've noticed a pattern in this war: Muslim terrorist groups attack Israel, broadcasting that they are great conquerors who are defeating the pathetic Zionists.

Israel responds, defeats or at least neutralizes the threat, and after a while, the Muslim terrorist groups can no longer keep up the image that they are destroying Israel. So they do a full 180 and paint themselves and poor pathetic victims being attacked by big bad Israel.

**Hamas:**

When they started attacking: We are great powerful Muslims destroying the evil Zionists! They tremble in our wake! Allahu Akbar!

Now: We are poor innocent victims, the Israelis are oppressive genociders! We are so pathetic! Why are they doing this to us?

**Hezbollah**

When they started attacking: We are great powerful Muslims destroying the evil Zionists! They tremble in our wake! Allahu Akbar!

Now: We are poor innocent victims, the Israelis are oppressive genociders! We are so pathetic! Why are they doing this to us?

**Iran**

When they started attacking: We are great powerful Muslims destroying the evil Zionists! They tremble in our wake! Allahu Akbar!



So how long do you think it'll take for the Islamic Regime to start crying "We are poor innocent victims, the Israelis are oppressive genociders! Why are they doing this to us?" I fully expect it to happen, and it's going to be hilarious for one of the most powerful countries in the Middle East, one that 85% of its people hate, will try to present itself as poor little oppressed victims.   
  
Also, do you think people actually keep falling for this ‚Äî like do they have the memories of goldfish? Or do they just hate Israel so they forget on purpose?

Title: One question for pro gazans supporters
Content: You condemn Israel bc its bombing gaza.
But when hamas fired over 15000 rockets and bombs at Israel cities in the first months of the war,using schools,mosques and hodpitals as firing points and ammunition storage,targeting Israel cities and civilians,when iran,houthy,hezbollah fired thousands of rockets,drones and bombs at Israel cities and only the fact that Israel cares about its people and invested billions of dolars in AA defence and air raid shelters prevented a huge numbers of civilians casualties bc all of those rockets,bombs and drones targeted major cities,day and night.Israel spent billions to protect its citizen,while hamas either spent the money gaza received on tunnels for them,not for the civilian population,weapons or they stole it(Hamas leaders are billionaires in dollars).
Why did you not speak them?Bc those targeted were jews and you dont care about them?Bc there were not a huge number of people killed bc Israel cares about its people?Why is the life of a child in gaza more precious then the life of a jewish child ?Why when jewish childrens were killed or terrorized by constant attacks you said nothing or even cheered on the attackers and when childrens in gaza are killed bc the war their parents started,you cry genocide and war crime?

Title: The assassination of Haniyeh is the type of attack Pro-Palestinians claim Israel should engage in
Content: The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is precisely the type of attack Pro-Palestinian advocates have claimed - since the start of the war - Israel should engage in. A precise targeted attack on a leader with zero civillian casualties. And yet, everyone is now claiming that Israel crossed a red line.

Over the past few months, as Gaza has been destroyed, activists have shouted about collective punishment and that Israel should only target Hamas and leave civillians alone. Ignoring for a second that Hamas hides amongst civillians and purposefully shields themselves with innocents -- the assassination in Iran is exactly the type of action anti-Israel activists argue Israel should be doing exclusively. And now he's being propped up, for bizarre reasons, as a peace-oriented statesman when there is much evidence to the contrary. And let's not forget Haniyeh saying on live TV that the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian innocents is worth it as part of the never-ending struggle to liberate Jerusalem from Isrel.

The hypocrisy is nothing new, but certainly worth pointing out. Haniyeh was part of a terrorist organization responsible for the death of thousands. If anything, Haniyeh's work not only resulted in the deaths of thousands, but he was a skilled terrorist politician who helped create and foster relationships with other terrorist entities across the Middle East.

The larger conclusion here is that it seems that many Pro-Palestinian activists simply don't wan't Israel to fight back in any way. If even a targeted assassination of a top Hamas figure that leaves no civillians injured is crossing a line, it seems as if the only thing Israel is "allowed" to do is nothing.

This of course isn't anything new. It's as if the world is mad Israel takes steps to protect itself. 

It remains to be seen how the death of Haniyeh impacts the region. Iran will of course respond, perhaps with a coordinated attack involving Hezbollah and the Houthis. 

One thing is for sure - Hamas' October 7 calculations have gone wildly astray. The only thing they have achieved is negative PR for Israel - meanwhile Hamas is slowly being dismantled and its leaders are being picked off one by one. All the while, the mass release of Palestinian prisoners has not happened because Hamas still refuses to ceasefire terms.

Title: A Nuclear Iran is not an Option
Content: A nuclear Iran would be an existential threat to Israel. A nuclear Iran would be a threat to the Iranian people. It will be a threat to the Middle East. It will be a threat to the world. 

Some folks are under the impression that a nuclear armed Iran could be contained because Iran is a rational actor. 

But is that really a trustworthy claim? 

Consider the precedents. 

Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, following a decade of proxy war, where Russian forces had fought Ukraine using barely veiled proxy forces. Ukraine was powerless to defend itself.

Ukraine couldn‚Äôt retaliate on Russian territory for years because its NATO suppliers forbade it from attacking on Russian territory. 

Why? Russian nukes. 

Russia has thousands of nuclear weapons. It had threatened to use them multiple times. Its threats coupled with its ability to realize these threats absolutely defined the entire dynamic of the Russia Ukraine war. 

Had Russia not been a nuclear power, Ukraine would be at peace today. A nuclear free Russia wouldn‚Äôt have dared to attack a NATO ally. If it attacked such an ally- it wouldn‚Äôt been defeated promptly, since the U.S. would‚Äôve intervened. 

Nuclear weapons have completely defined modern warfare so far. They will continue defining warfare in the future. 

We only know about what happened to this day. We don‚Äôt know precisely the effect nuclear arms will have on future conflicts. We saw in Ukraine one possible scenario- a nuclear state invaded a democratic state and got absolute immunity from a counterattack, because of its nuclear insurance policy. That war is still going on, because Russia still has nuclear weapons. 

And Russia is a secular, western nation. Its rulers are former communists and have European values like secularism, women‚Äôs equality and individualism. Russia is a westernized nation. So, rational, right? 

Iran - not Russia. 

Iran is ruled by fanatical religious groups who believe in god will reward them with eternal life of bliss if they kill a Jew. 

So if Russia, westernized, secular society with women‚Äôs rights and a cultural elite once dominated by liberal European values, attacks a country and gets away with it because it threatens to nuke London and New York - what‚Äôs going to happen when literal jihadi terrorists get nuclear weapons?


What happened when we gave these terrorists a state? 

Massacres, rape, and terrorism. 

What will happen when these terrorists get nuclear weapons?

Not hard to imagine. 


This is why I say - nuclear Iran is not an option.

Title: Pro-Palestinians why is it so hard for you guys to admit that certain agencies/groups/ngo's are biased against / obsessed with hating on Israel?
Content: I've been talking to pro-palestinians for a while and I've noticed a significant portion of Pro-Palestinians like to deny that agencies/groups/ngo's are in any way biased against / obsessed with hating on Israel despite many examples that make this fact pretty obviously true 

* the UNGA is biased against Israel despite facts like in 2024 the UNGA passed resolutions on:¬†ISRAEL 17¬†Russia 1¬† Syria 1¬† North Korea 1¬† Iran 1¬† US 1 Sudan 1  Myanmar 1¬†Venezuela 0¬†  Lebanon 0¬† Pakistan 0¬† Hamas 0¬† Algeria 0¬† Turkey 0¬† China 0¬† Qatar 0¬† Saudi 0¬†  Cuba 0¬† Iraq 0¬† Afghanistan 0
* CNN in July, August, and September 2023 in the Middle East section on CNN.com 43 out of 99 were about Israel and this clearly this isn't about casualties because Sudan which had 3,595 conflict-related fatalities had only 2 articles written about itself at the same time Israel had 109 conflict-related fatalities during that time, but had¬†43 articles written about itself. it isn't about freedoms either because the freedomhouse an organization which ranks how free countries are ranks Israel higher than all the countries in it region (and also they just factually are unrelated to any ratings)
*  Human right watch is so bad one of its founders even said as much he said "The region is populated by authoritarian regimes with appalling human rights records. Yet in recent years Human Rights Watch has written far more condemnations of Israel for violations of international law than of any other country in the region" also they legit put Shawan Jabarin¬†someone who was part of the PFLP on the middle east advisory board an in 2006 to 2009 Human Rights Watch's had 87 criticisms of Israeli conduct against the Palestinians and Hezbollah, versus eight criticisms of Palestinian and four of Hezbollah

these are just a few examples there are many more but if you can't admit that this is bias and it exists then I really think you can't begin to have an honest discussion about the topic

Title: Who is responsible bastardising the word ‚ÄúZionist‚Äù and making it synonyms with ‚Äúgenocidal ethnostate supporting Nazi maniac‚Äù
Content: I‚Äôm not Jewish, but I‚Äôm just so mad about this. There‚Äôs such a huge disconnect happening here, has anyone got to the bottom of it? It‚Äôs completely crazy and I‚Äôm fundamentally confused. 

I guess what I was getting at, engaging in and popularising polarising language is in  my opinion just playing into the hands of whoever is trying to create chaos right?  We‚Äôre just little social media propaganda pawns for these other big players own agendas, and fuck that! 

If you look at it- who self identifies as zionists- literally most Jews‚Ä¶. Because to them it means ‚Äúself determination in our homeland of Israel‚Äù 

Who decided that Zionist means ‚Äúgenocidal colonist, ethnostate Nazi maniac‚Äù ???

Like wtf why do Jewish people have to be told by a bunch of idiots supporting jihad who they are?  

I dunno who first bastardised the word? maybe the crazy conservative Netanyahu government, maybe the Islamist fundamentalists, maybe Iranian funded Qatari media? 

Either way- fundamentally- using it in such a negative flippant way is just an excuse to demonise and ostracise Jews. They may be an afghani or Syrian Jew and identify as a Zionist. How does that work? Are they Arab? 

It feels like you‚Äôve never known a religious fundamentalist or anyone in a cult. I have and I hate it. I hate seeing people manipulated through guilt, hate or dogma. 

It feels racist tbh to think that jihadi groups with their own agendas aren‚Äôt smart enough to manipulate the western rhetoric.  And It‚Äôs pretty obvious that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre seeing. Why tf are all these Hamas kids at the ‚Äúhostage release parades (!!!?!!!!!?!!!????) swanning around with iphone 12s and vapes??!??? SERIOUSLY WHAT The HELL! And if we‚Äôre suspicious and critical of western media, like the BBC or whoever (as we should be) why do people not apply that same criticism to Al Jazeera ‚ÄúAustralia‚Äù. 
Like do people genuinely think middle eastern people live in romantic caves with olive trees and no access to the internet? Do people think they don‚Äôt have the same potential for good and evil? Are they immune to indoctrination? Do they- especially women, deserve less autonomy and rights  than we have?? do people think they‚Äôre not human??????? 
 
It‚Äôs completely ridiculous. Makes absolutely no sense. People in the west keep banging on about how it‚Äôs about indigenous land. If it was about land and not extremest ideology why isn‚Äôt it over? Why didn‚Äôt Yasa Arrafat make peace instead of orchestrating suicide bombings at the last second? 

Why was the grand mufti friends with hitler?  

One reason  obvs now days I reckon (apart from just very very old ingraned insidious rampant constant antisemitism) is Because the Palestinians get billions of dollars in refugee aid which goes straight to the top. If they keep needing aid they keep getting paid. - Iran that is- at the end of the day. The Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon has been there for over 50 years- their situation is completely exploited by the PA, the Lebanese government and now Hezbollah- through receiving aid money. As long as they‚Äôre refugees the money keeps rolling in. They can‚Äôt leave the camp, they have no access to medical care, jobs, anything. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about this? 

The guys at the top don‚Äôt give a fuck about minorities or culture. 

Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about the fact that Jordan doesn‚Äôt want any Gazan refugees because Hamas tried to overthrow their government by force a few years ago?

Why don‚Äôt people talk about the half a million Syrians killed by the Assad regime and now the fact that the Turkish backed militia is killing Kurds left right and centre and the Druze population of Syria is seeking protection from Israel because they‚Äôre terrified of being murderd under the new Islamist  leaders. 

Who does the Houthi flag (which I‚Äôve seen at heaps of rallies in Sydney and in Melbourne) translates to to ‚Äúdeath to America, death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews, victory to Islam‚Äù help?
 
The same groups who have been shipped off to butcher people in North Africa in the name of jihad. The same groups who have told moroccans they‚Äôre not Ahmazig they‚Äôre ‚Äúarab‚Äù and gone about erasing native language. The same fundamentalists who murder Yazidis because their creation story revolves around a peacock god. The same fundamentalists who have a town in Gaza where all the black people live called Al-abib , which ltranslates to ‚Äúslave town‚Äù 

How on earth can anyone who‚Äôs grown up with vaguely western values support this???  I‚Äôm on board with - you don‚Äôt have the right to tell anyone else‚Äôs what they should think or believe- but so many white left pro Palestinian ‚Äúfreedom fighters‚Äù are doing just that. Demanding that people be on board with their ‚Äú oh just work up today to cosplay my revolutionary ‚Äúglobalise the intifada‚Äù ‚Äú shtick‚Äù or you‚Äôre a genocidal racist?!!! ITS COMPLETELY CRAZY  

Why is the conversation always about 
~~~ ZIONISTSSSS~~ 

And what does that even mean and to who?!! 

It‚Äôs crazy!

either that or I am ughhhhh

Title: Israel vs Gaza, WB or Iran. Israel Is A Democracy
Content: Someone is Palestine sub, posted vid of Palestinians flag waving and celebrating Nakba at Tel Aviv Univ. Comment states how brave they are. 

No. That's not the point. The point is that they are not being shot. For those who say Israel is apartheid, take note.

Israel is waiting for terrorists and dictators .. Hamas and Abbas to make peace. Israel has tried and is ready.

Title: Pro Palestinians who are anti Hamas - where is your sympathy?
Content: According to your logic, moderate Palestinians are the real victims as they get caught up despite the fact Hamas historically aggressed. 

Where are your posts for the innocent Israelis who are caught up in this war with Iran? I haven't seen a single piece of news dedicated to innocents on the Israeli side, for example suburbs bombed in Tel Aviv and Haifa. We all know if Iran had the capability to obliterate Israel it would, the leadership have stated as such many times. Why does Iran deserve to be held to such a low standard, receiving no judgement for indiscriminate killing whereas Israel has to have perfect accuracy despite facing such adversity?  Regardless of your position Israel let's agree does not fire blindly and indiscriminately, if it did, the death toll would be fire higher, even taking the most liberal of Hamas numbers Israel has capability to kill many more. We can debate as to the lengths they go to and whether it'll ever be enough, but let's not get side tracked. 

I don't want to hear 'no such thing as an innocent Israeli' or 'they just want to see us dead' style conversations. Good natured debate only please. 

EDIT: guys, let's not debate whether it was provoked. I believe the IRGC have spoken about wanting to destroy Israel openly for years, and has sponsored terrorist groups etc. But let's ignore that and focus on innocent civilians, we can all agree kids in Tel Aviv didn't pre emotively attack the IRGC. 

Edit 2 appreciate most responses, am off to sleep, will come back to peeps tomoz.

Title: Why didn‚Äôt Egypt evacuate Palestinian children out of Gaza? 
Content: Hundreds of thousands of children are stuck in a war zone because the Islamists and the leftist idiots who support them decided that moving the children out of the war zone would be ‚Äúethnic cleansing‚Äù.

Ya know, the exact same thing that Ukrainians, British, and pretty much every other group of people did‚Ä¶ send their kids away from the war zone. I‚Äôm sure many parents in Gaza would jump at the chance to get their kids to safety. And yet for some bizarre reason, that was never offered to them. Not by their BFF Egypt and certainly not by their BFF Iran.

Most of them have already lost their homes. Babies are dying from the cold. They are living in tents and struggling to feed themselves. On top of that, most of them hate Hamas (they also hate Israel, but that goes without saying). They see how Hamas is stealing their food. They know that Hamas uses their homes and tents to launch missiles, which is why bombs are falling on the heads of innocent civilians. 

Israel is not going to stop the war until Hamas is destroyed. I think it goes without saying, but the hostages are a secondary concern for the Israeli government when it comes to choosing the hostages vs the security of the entire nation. You can argue with me about that all you want, but this post isn‚Äôt about that. 

This is about the moral imperative to evacuate children out of war zones. These are children who have nothing to do with the conflict and deserve a chance to live. I have personally spoken with someone from Gaza. They feel that there is nothing left for them there. It‚Äôs going to take years to rebuild. All they desperately want is to leave, but the world is forcing them to stay there‚Äîaccording to leftists and Islamists, they are all Hamas ‚Äúmartyrs‚Äù; according to the right wing, they‚Äôre all potential terrorists. 

I‚Äôm genuinely asking why no one is talking about this and why everyone seems to be okay with having children be left in a war zone. Children are innocent. They are not ‚Äúmartyrs‚Äù. They are just small souls being used as a pawn in a bigger game.

Title: Israel shouldn't exist - Brief History + Extras
Content: It's history time kids!!!
Zionism Before the Holocaust
Jewish Zionists wanting to settle in Palestine was a plan before the Holocaust.
The Zionist movement formally began in the late 19th century, notably with Theodor Herzl‚Äôs publication of Der Judenstaat in 1896.
‚Ä¢ Herzl and other early Zionists believed that Jews constituted a nation in exile and required a homeland to escape European antisemitism.
‚Ä¢ The First Zionist Congress was held in 1897 in Basel, Switzerland, where the goal was articulated: establishing a legally recognized Jewish homeland in Palestine.

British Involvement and the Balfour Declaration (1917)
‚Ä¢ In 1917, during WWI, the British government issued the Balfour Declaration, expressing support for a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine.
‚Ä¢ After WWI, Britain received the League of Nations Mandate to govern Palestine and facilitate this policy.
‚Ä¢ Palestinian Arabs (majority) were excluded from decisions.
‚Ä¢ Tensions escalated with increased Jewish immigration, leading to several revolts and uprisings.

The Holocaust and Pressure for a Jewish State
‚Ä¢ Although Zionism was already well established, the Holocaust (1941‚Äì1945) drastically shifted global support.
‚Ä¢ Six million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany creating global sympathy and pressure for a Jewish State
‚Ä¢ After WWII, Palestine was seen as the only viable refuge for displaced Jews.

UN Partition Plan & Creation of Israel (1947‚Äì1948)
‚Ä¢ In 1947, the UN proposed partitioning Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states.
‚Ä¢ Jewish leaders accepted the plan; Arab leaders rejected it.
‚Ä¢ On May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion declared the State of Israel.
‚Ä¢ Surrounding Arab nations invaded, starting the First Arab-Israeli War.

The Nakba (1947‚Äì1949)
"Nakba" = ‚ÄúCatastrophe‚Äù in Arabic.
The mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians during Israel‚Äôs establishment.
Summary:
‚Ä¢ 700,000‚Äì750,000 Palestinians displaced
‚Ä¢ 10,000‚Äì15,000 Palestinians killed
‚Ä¢ 400+ villages depopulated/destroyed
‚Ä¢ Key events:
‚Ä¢ UN Partition Plan (Nov 1947)
‚Ä¢ Civil war escalation (Dec 1947‚ÄìMay 1948)
‚Ä¢ Israeli independence (May 14, 1948)
‚Ä¢ Mass expulsions (1948‚Äì49)
‚Ä¢ Notable massacres: Deir Yassin, Lydda, Ramle

Albert Einstein and Israel
‚Ä¢ In 1952, Einstein was offered the presidency of Israel.
‚Ä¢ He declined.
‚Ä¢ In a 1948 letter, he warned against Israeli nationalism and its treatment of Palestinians ‚Äî fearing resemblance to oppressive regimes.
(What kind of regime could he possibly be referring to?)

Systematic Killing of Palestinians (Before Oct 7th)
Major Killings:
‚Ä¢ 1956 Suez Crisis ‚Äì Hundreds killed
‚Ä¢ 1982 Sabra & Shatila ‚Äì Indirect Israeli responsibility
‚Ä¢ 1987‚Äì1993 First Intifada ‚Äì Several hundred deaths
‚Ä¢ 2002 Operation Defensive Shield ‚Äì ~500 killed
‚Ä¢ 2008‚Äì09 Cast Lead ‚Äì 1,400+ killed
‚Ä¢ 2012 Pillar of Defense ‚Äì ~160 killed
‚Ä¢ 2014 Protective Edge ‚Äì 2,200+ killed
‚Ä¢ 2018 Great March of Return ‚Äì 200+ killed
‚Ä¢ 2021 May Gaza Conflict ‚Äì 250+ killed
‚Ä¢ 2022 Raids/Strikes ‚Äì Hundreds killed

Palestinian Prisoners (Before Oct 7th):
‚Ä¢ 4,500‚Äì5,000 Palestinians detained, including
‚Ä¢ 500‚Äì600 administrative detainees (no charges)
‚Ä¢ These include children detainees

War Crimes
1. Illegal Israeli Settlements
Expansion and maintenance of settlements in occupied Palestinian territories (West Bank, East Jerusalem) declared illegal by the International Court of Justice (2004 advisory opinion) and UN Security Council Resolutions (e.g., 2334 in 2016).

2. Construction of the Separation Barrier (Wall)
Declared illegal by the ICJ (2004) where it extends into occupied territory, violating international humanitarian law.

3. Disproportionate Attacks and Indiscriminate Use of Force
UN reports and OHCHR investigations have documented multiple incidents where Israeli military operations in Gaza caused disproportionate civilian deaths and damage (e.g., 2008-09 Cast Lead, 2014 Protective Edge, 2021 Gaza conflict).

4. Attacks on Protected Objects and Civilians
Strikes on UN shelters, hospitals, schools (documented in UN and human rights reports) violating the principle of distinction under international humanitarian law.

5. Collective Punishment through Blockade of Gaza
The land, air, and sea blockade imposed on Gaza since 2007 is considered by many international bodies (including UN experts) as collective punishment prohibited by international law.

6. Forced Displacement and Home Demolitions
Demolition of Palestinian homes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, including punitive demolitions and those linked to settlement expansion, violating the Fourth Geneva Convention.

7. Administrative Detention and Torture
Use of administrative detention without charge or trial, including of minors; documented torture and ill-treatment of Palestinian detainees reported by UN committees and human rights groups.

8. Use of Live Fire Against Protesters
Killings and injuries of unarmed Palestinian protesters during events such as the Great March of Return (2018-2019), criticized as excessive and unlawful use of force.

9. Extrajudicial Executions
Targeted killings without judicial process of Palestinians suspected of militant activities, violating due process rights.

10. Restrictions on Movement and Access
Severe restrictions on Palestinians‚Äô freedom of movement within the West Bank and Gaza, including checkpoints and the separation barrier, impacting access to healthcare, education, and livelihoods.

11. Destruction of Agricultural and Economic Resources
Confiscation or destruction of Palestinian agricultural lands, olive trees, and infrastructure tied to settlements and military operation.

12. Denial of Access to Adequate Water and Sanitation
Restrictions on Palestinian access to water resources in the occupied territories, violating international human rights and humanitarian l

13. Discrimination Against Palestinian Citizens of Israel
Institutional discrimination affecting rights related to land, housing, and political participation recognized by human rights organizations.

Investigations and Legal Actions
International Criminal Court (ICC): Investigating multiple aspects of Israel‚Äôs conduct since 2014, including settlement activity and military operations in Gaza.

United Nations Human Rights Council: Multiple commissions of inquiry have found evidence consistent with war crimes and called for accountability.

Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, B‚ÄôTselem: Extensive documentation and legal analysis supporting claims of war crimes and rights violations.

Hamas and Israeli Involvement
Funding via Qatar (2012‚Äì2021)
Between 2012 and 2021, Israel allowed Qatar to transfer over $1.5 billion into Gaza, which funded Hamas salaries and governance under Israeli supervision. This strategy aimed to weaken the Palestinian Authority and manage Hamas‚Äôs power as a political tool, despite the risk of empowering a militant group.

October 7th: Intelligence Failure or Israeli allowed attack to justify a genocide
Myself and others, including intelligence insiders, believe the 6‚Äì8 hour unimpeded attack is not just a failure, but a historic anomaly that defies the usual capabilities of Israel‚Äôs defense system.

‚Ä¢ Israel's military and surveillance capabilities are world-class
‚Ä¢ Yet a 6‚Äì8 hour assault happened with no intervention?

Surveillance Infrastructure:
1. Border Fence Tech
‚Ä¢ Smart Border Fence
‚Ä¢ A high-tech barrier built along the Gaza Strip (65+ km long) Equipped with:
‚Ä¢ Ground sensors (vibration, seismic)
‚Ä¢ Motion detectors
‚Ä¢ Thermal cameras
‚Ä¢  Day/night vision cameras
‚Ä¢  Radars for tracking movement
B. Remote-Controlled Weapon Stations
‚Ä¢ "Sentry Tech" system,
‚Ä¢ automated machine guns linked to observation posts operated remotely with real-time video feed from surveillance towers
‚Ä¢ Often paired with AI-assisted target tracking.
Watch Towers & Surveillance Posts
‚Ä¢ Dozens of towers along the border, with:
‚Ä¢  360-degree high-resolution cameras
‚Ä¢  Thermal infrared imaging systems
‚Ä¢  Night vision
‚Ä¢  Microphone sensors

2. Drones / Balloons / Satellites
‚Ä¢ Tethered balloons with radar and cameras, they provide wide-area thermal and video surveillance, high altitude, persistent monitoring
C. Satellite Surveillance
‚Ä¢ Israel has military satellites (e.g., Ofek series) for:
‚Ä¢ Monitoring troop and vehicle movement
‚Ä¢ Detecting heat signatures (thermal anomalies)
‚Ä¢ Drones (UAVs)
‚Ä¢ Continuous drone coverage over Gaza, including: Heron, Hermes 450/900, Elbit Skylark
Capabilities:
‚Ä¢ Thermal imaging
‚Ä¢  High-res optical zoom
‚Ä¢  Facial recognition (via AI)
‚Ä¢  Real-time video stream to IDF command

3. SIGINT / Cyber Surveillance
‚Ä¢ Systems like ‚ÄúLavender‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Gospel‚Äù (exposed in 2024 leaks) Identify targets via AI and big data
‚Ä¢ Can autonomously mark phones or homes for strikes
‚Ä¢ Use voice, movement, call frequency, SIM card data to detect threats

Electronic and Signal Intelligence (SIGINT)
‚Ä¢ A. Cyber & Communications Intercepts
‚Ä¢ Monitors Hamas communications, mobile networks, encrypted apps
‚Ä¢ Uses AI to flag suspicious patterns in metadata

4. Human Surveillance
‚Ä¢ Facial Recognition at Crossings
‚Ä¢ At Erez and other checkpoints
‚Ä¢ Live biometric scanning for workers and civilians entering Israel

B. Palestinian Informants
Israel‚Äôs security agency (Shin Bet) has historically recruited informants within Gaza and the West Bank
This supplements digital intelligence

5. Integrated Command
‚Ä¢  All surveillance feeds converge in IDF Southern Command HQ and Unit 8200 (Israel‚Äôs equivalent of the NSA)
‚Ä¢ Real-time AI alert systems flag:
‚Ä¢ Unusual movement on the fence
‚Ä¢ Heat signatures
‚Ä¢ Breaches or destruction of sensors

Conclusion: Why Didn‚Äôt They Act?
‚Ä¢ Any mass movement of people, bulldozers, or paragliders near or at the fence should have triggered immediate alerts. It's almost unfeasible that the attack went "undetected" despite warnings from Egypt and Isrsel knowing the summary of what the attack would be years prior.

Why Israel is Fundamentally a Bad Idea
Creating a state around a single religion or ethnic identity, even when cloaked in secular governance, consistently leads to radicalism, exclusion, and often violence for several reasons: 

1. In Group vs Out Group Mentality
‚Ä¢ Jewish identity as basis excludes others
‚Ä¢ Radical nationalism rises
‚Ä¢ When a state defines itself by one identity (e.g., "Jewish state", "Islamic Republic"), it automatically others everyone else minorities become second class, even if granted formal rights.
‚Ä¢ This fosters radical nationalism to "protect" the identity group and suppress dissent.

2. It demands Constant Defense
‚Ä¢ Threat narrative = Justification for oppressionEthno-religious states often feel existentially threatened by demographics, dissent, or neighbors.
‚Ä¢ That fear justifies:
‚Ä¢ Militarization
‚Ä¢ Surveillance of minorities
‚Ä¢ Suppressing internal critique
In Israel‚Äôs case: a constant narrative of existential threat has justified decades of occupation and repression.

3. Breeds Extremism
‚Ä¢ When the state and religion/ethnicity are fused, radicals claim to speak for the state or faith.
‚Ä¢ In Israel, messianic settlers and ultranationalists now influence policy.
‚Ä¢ The same happened in:
‚Ä¢ Pakistan (rise of Taliban-like extremism)
‚Ä¢ India (Hindutva and anti-Muslim policies)
‚Ä¢ Iran (hardline Shia theocracy)

4. Demographic Engineering
‚Ä¢ Controls Palestinian demographics (e.g. through blockade, exile, settlements)
‚Ä¢ Denies equal rights to millions under occupation.

Israel is a real-time case study of how founding a state on a singular ethno religious identity, in a multiethnic region, has led to radicalization, apartheid like conditions, and endless conflict.

Final Word
Israel is a Zionist-created state, not representative of all Jews.
‚Ä¢ Founded through violence and dispossession
‚Ä¢ Committed systematic killings
‚Ä¢ Instigated conflicts
‚Ä¢ Funded Hamas
‚Ä¢ Took hostages pre-Oct 7th
‚Ä¢ Tortured prisoners
It should be abolished.
*Big out breath*
Woo that felt good.

Sorry if there's errors it's 2am I'm going to bed

Title: How long until Hamas surrenders?
Content: I don't quite understand why Hamas hasn't surrendered/agreed to leave and allow Egypt to rebuild Gaza without it. 
Israel seems to have shown that, at least for the next four years while Trump is in power, there is no rebuilding Gaza with them being armed.

It was different when Iran/Hezbollah/Hamas could coordinate to try to reclaim Palestine, but now all three are functionally incapable of fighting. Hezbollah is weaker than Lebanon now, Iran's air defenses are disabled and Russia isn't helping, Hamas isnt capable of getting out of Gaza to attack Israel anymore. 

Could someone explain their actual plan/expectation of the future at this point?

Deaths of civilians are always horrible, I'm not asking about what would be a just outcome. I am simply trying to understand why Hamas' negotiating position hasn't changed as their strategic position has deteriorated.

Title: Why do Muslims completely ignore the death of millions in the Muslim world?
Content: Whenever i talk to a pro palestinian, more specifically a muslim pro palestinian they claim is Israel is comminting a genocide in Gaza by killing around 38k people, which at least a 10k of them are declared terrorists.

When i ask where were they when Bashar Al-Assad mustard gassed 600k of his own people and displaced over 7 million people in Sryia, Or about the 400k dead in Yemen killed by the Houthis and the millions that have been displaced there? Or maybe we should talk about the millions of Muslims being transferred from Pakistan to Afghanistan? Perhaps the civil war in Libya, Egypt, Sryia, the attempt in Turkey and the countless tries in Iran ring any bells? The list of problems and death in the Muslim world goes on and on and i don't think there are enough characters to write them all.

I had many conversations with muslims about this issue, some told me after i stated what i've just said and more that they are not perfect but immediately brought the conversation back to be about Israel and Palestine. Some told me and i find it even worse, let Arabs be Arabs?? 
Can someone explain me the hypocrisy?

I truly want to believe it's not only about antisemitism and hating Jews but has time goes by and i grow older i find that the Muslims don't care about their "fellow" Muslims, they just seek the death of Jews. Many of them including in Europe and America grew up on the idea that Jews are the source to all of their mistakes and miserably. 

I know some will not believe me, but in Israel we grow up on values of peace, they always remind us in school that you're not doing peace with your friends, you're doinf it with your enemies but now we grow to know the middle east better and better each year and understand that the Muslims and Arabs are not even not even friends with each other (Sunni and Shia and many more) so how can we be friends with someone who doesn't even love themselves? Will they ever wake up to understand they are the problem and the worst enemy of themselves?

Title: Why Anti-Zionism is Antisemitism
Content: **The Modern World and Its Selective Criticism of Israel: Why Anti-Zionism is Antisemitism**

The modern world is often willing to hide almost anything, but there is one thing that always remains at the forefront of global public consciousness ‚Äì criticism of Israel. When it comes to Israel, it seems that every discussion immediately turns into a political act, every expression of opinion is accompanied by a headline that turns it into a symbol of ideology. At the same time, anti-Zionism ‚Äì the opposition to the Zionist idea and the existence of the State of Israel ‚Äì appears to be much more than a political or ideological category. It is not just an opinion, but also a clear expression of antisemitism.

# The Basic Reason: Selectivity in Criticism

Anti-Zionism does not exist in a vacuum of political criticism of other countries. The political, social, and military struggles that take place in various parts of the world ‚Äì civil wars, population suppression, crimes against humanity ‚Äì often do not receive the attention they deserve. For example, the Syrian civil war, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, or the oppression of the Uyghurs in China ‚Äì these countries do not receive the same level of political and media scrutiny that Israel does. No one is talking about the atrocities in China or Syria.

The political situation in Egypt or Iran, where human rights are trampled in every possible field, is rarely discussed in the international discourse in the same way. Israel, which is ultimately a democratic state with an independent judicial system, law enforcement, and proportional use of military force, receives widespread global media focus. What other reason could there be for this, if not latent antisemitism, or anti-Zionism that carries with it hatred toward everything associated with the Jewish people and the existence of a Jewish state?

# Anti-Zionism as a Form of Antisemitism

It is important to understand that anti-Zionism is not just about territorial disputes; it also involves viewing Jews as dangerous and threatening. The denial of the Jewish people's right to exist in their own state, and the use of anti-Jewish terms to label Israel as a "bad state" or a "cruel state," are part of modern antisemitic rhetoric.

Zionism is not just about the establishment of a Jewish state in the Land of Israel; it is also about the idea of equal rights for all citizens of the state. When criticism of Israel focuses on the struggle for human rights, it is crucial to differentiate between legitimate criticism and the use of hateful elements directed at the Jewish people and Jewish identity. This is precisely the aim of anti-Zionism. It has not only political implications, but also ideological and cultural ones.

# Selective Justice

The world is flooded with injustices, crimes, and atrocities. Many nations live under tyrannical rule, some have no freedom of speech, and the rights of women, minorities, or other religions are violated daily. Yet, none of this seems to interest the world. But when it comes to Israel, comparisons and accusations flow relentlessly: Israel as an "apartheid state," Israel as a "racist state," Israel as a "state of oppression." Despite having no resemblance to the apartheid regime in South Africa, and despite Israel being a democratic state with an open political system, the world continues to accuse it.

The political motivation behind this is clear. It is a form of hypocrisy that arises specifically when it comes to the Jewish people and their right to live in dignity and in a free state. Why? Because this strikes at the heart of the Western world‚Äôs consciousness. Antisemitism may not always be overt, and it is often not visible, but it touches deeply on the historical fears of many cultures ‚Äì the fear of Jewish prosperity, the fear of anything connected to Jews.

# Global Hypocrisy

The world, which simply does not see the real oppression taking place in other countries, chooses to focus on one country, Israel, and accuse it. Indeed, despite the fact that countless countries have committed or are committing crimes against humanity, there is a continuous escalation of accusations against Israel. This is not a coincidence. This is exactly what makes anti-Zionism antisemitism: the selective treatment, the distinct differentiation between countries committing greater crimes, and Israel, which is ultimately required to act in a reality of existential struggle, surrounded by enemies in states that demand the destruction of the Jewish state.

So simply put ‚Äì yes, anti-Zionism is antisemitism. It is not legitimate criticism of a state; it is the pointing of an accusing finger at an entire people, at Zionism, at the idea of Jewish freedom. It is the hypocrisy of the world, which agrees to ignore the atrocities happening around the globe, but cannot see the true threat facing only one Jewish state.

Title: Why is Israel acting aggressively against the new Syrian government?
Content: As soon as Syrian rebels successfully overthrew the Assad regime, Israel launched an aggressive military campaign in Syria. Over three days, the IDF conducted approximately 500 airstrikes, devastating 70-80% of Syria‚Äôs military assets and destroying nearly its entire naval fleet. In parallel, Israeli forces advanced into Syria from the Golan Heights, seizing control of strategic surrounding territory.

But what does Israel aim to achieve with this operation? The collapse of Assad‚Äôs regime already represents a significant strategic gain for Israel. Iran has lost a key ally and a critical supply route for arming Hezbollah. Furthermore, the leading rebel faction, HTS, which is poised to dominate the new Syrian government, harbors deep hostility toward both Iran and Hezbollah.

While I understand Israel‚Äôs concerns about the potential threat posed by HTS‚Äîgiven its Islamist ideology and its roots as an Al Qaeda affiliate‚Äîtheir aggressive approach appears premature and counterproductive. The world is closely observing HTS to determine whether their supposed shift toward moderation is genuine or merely a PR move to gain legitimacy during the civil war. And the jury is still very much out. At the moment, HTS is focused on consolidating power and forming a functional government, not initiating conflict with Israel or anyone else for that matter. 

By preemptively treating HTS as a direct threat, Israel is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Rather than taking a measured approach to gauge the intentions of Syria‚Äôs new leadership, these actions are forcing their hand. It just seems strategically short-sighted. Even if HTS does pose a future threat, Israel‚Äôs immediate aggression could ensure a more adversarial relationship than might have otherwise developed.

Thoughts?

Title: Palestine is Ruining the Left
Content: I'm an Israeli-American leftist who has been active in American and Israeli politics for a number of years now. I have always advocated for human rights, equity, and self-determination for Palestinians who are oppressed(to different extents) under Israel, a nation that commits itself to Jewish domination of institutions. I always voted and campaigned for progressive Democrats and I assisted with the Israeli Meretz party from abroad. This is why I think the current Palestinian-sympathetic movement is ruining the left:

1. **Abandonment of Pragmatism** \- Just like the 2020 George Floyd protests("Defund the Police"), the Western left has completely embraced a suicidal strategy of idealistic radicalism. Many of those on the left insist the solution to the conflict is a one-state solution consisting of Palestine "from the River to the Sea". Unfortunately, they've appropriated the Palestinian mythology in their ambitions to magically destroy Israel and the ideology of Zionism by BDS somehow or supporting Palestinian "armed struggle". It doesn't take a lot of thought to see how both of those methods are incredibly ineffective and immoral to advocate for and implement. So, instead of a pragmatic approach, like empowering the Israeli left through donations and advocacy, supporting a reasonable solution(two-state or one-state under Israel), or calling for the ultimate humanitarian end to the war of a unilateral Hamas surrender, the Western left insists on a dream scenario that will never happen. This is the most egregious behavior of the left and it's their most common mistake(i.e. Vietnam). This is due to the fact that Palestinians, especially in Gaza, are suffering under disproportionate Israeli force with no Western movement to realistically end it. In fact, these Western leftists, due to these tactics, are assisting in empowering and legitimizing the far-right of Israel. They are the perfect strawman to turn people off to the left in Israel, which, in turn, results in a lengthened Palestinian suffering.
2. **Maximalism** \- There's a tendency on the left to outcompete each other in radicalism. It's not catchy or sexy to say "The war tactics that Israel uses are disproportionate and don't consider enough of the humanitarian cost", it has to be "genocide" or "ethnic cleansing" in order to provoke an emotional reaction from uneducated Westerners. It's not "the security policy of Hafradah has resulted in reduced human rights of Palestinians compared to Israelis", it has to be "Apartheid"(with the only legal precedent being South Africa). These maximalist statements immeasurably hurt the movement for true progress on Palestinian human rights. It results in a boy-who-cried-wolf situation: If Israel decides to transfer the entire Gazan population to the Sinai, what is that called? A "genocide"? Due to the present labeling of the war, nobody will believe it. What if Israel permanently transfers or kills 100,000 Palestinian civilians? 200,000? 1 million? What will that be called? How can it get worse than "genocide"? This Maximalist rhetoric is not only inaccurate, but it's incredibly damaging to describe the proportionate extent of Palestinian suffering, which is vital to any movement that faithfully advocates for an upliftment of Palestinian life and identity.
3. **Normalization of Bigotry** \- Explicit or latent Jew-Hatred is being increasingly embraced by radical sections of the Western left. Tropes such as "Zionist"(a euphemism for "Jew" for many) control of governments or blood libel. Wishing "Death to Zionists" or equating them with Nazis is, in most cases, latent Jew-Hatred. Regardless of your thoughts on the definition of Zionism(there is no definition, it is a meaningless term), it's clear that many believe that "Zionists" are just uppity Jews. Of course, this is genuinely believed by a small portion of the left. However, a substantial part of Western leftists has repeatedly failed to condemn this Jew-Hatred and to stop mirroring the language of these latent or explicit Jew-Haters. This is 1000x worse in the case of Israelis. For Western leftists, it's normal to call Israelis "colonizers", "demons", "rapists", and "child-murderers" on their social media without repercussion or introspective irony. As somebody belonging to the Israeli nationality, I have been desensitized to the insane amount of bigotry from those that I formerly respected. However, many Israelis or Jews aren't as depersonalized as I am, and they definitely take the bigotry to heart. What do you think results from that? Usually, a vote for Likud(Netanyahu's Party) or a donation to AIPAC. Thus, propagating a cycle of bigotry and continuing the suffering of Palestinians.
4. **Propaganda** \- This war has sparked the largest disinformation campaigns in human history. Multiple state entities (Israel, U.S., Russia, Iran, Qatar) and numerous private entities are pumping out loads of propaganda in order to manipulate uneducated Westerners into supporting their interests. Since October 7th, known Russian disinformation propagator, Jackson Hinkle, has skyrocketed in followers due to his ability to mislead Western leftists on the war. I have seen an unfathomable amount of reposts from Al Jazeera and MiddleEastEye, known Qatari state propaganda and major propagates of misinformation. I have always appreciated the value of institutional skepticism that embodied many of the historical and academic leftist leaders. However, right now, those values are completely thrown out in favor of Russia or Iran's geopolitical advocacy of "everything the West does is bad". The previous three points of behavior are certainly emboldened by the paid disinformation and bots that propagate anti-Western sentiment to destabilize Western democracy. Meanwhile, the basic interests of Palestinian civilians are left unregarded while these state operatives kill their only lifeline.
5. **Reactionary Resurgence** \- One of the main factors that attracted me to the left was its rejection of reactionary ideology(the establishment of traditional institutions from the past). For Israelis and Palestinians, reactionary rhetoric is normalized and encouraged in many cases. However, this reactionary ideology that has plagued those who share my nationality has spread to Western leftists in their advocacy for Palestine. Western leftists constantly appropriate the far-right and reactionary talking points that many radicalized Palestinians spout. An example would be the insistence on the exclusive indigeneity of Palestine from the River to the Sea, which abandons the progressive values of anti-nationalism and intersectionality. Another example would be the appropriation of Palestinian Martyrdom, in which many of them embraced the idea that human life can be inherently reduced to a political or national cause by their manner of death. This is a clear rejection of the values of individualism, secularism, and anti-nationalism.
6. **Historical Negligence** \- Those who are even a little bit informed on the Israel-Palestinian Conflict understand that the conflict is too complex to be treated as a soccer match of Israelis vs. Palestinians. Many Israeli and Palestinian leaders set roadblocks to an equitable peace, while many others progressed the conflict to a more positive state. Even more than the historical complexity of this conflict, evaluating the moral complexity requires a graduate degree in a relevant field with hundreds of hours of research. I typically advise not to trust anybody's commentary of the conflict with any less credibility than the previous sentence. However, the Western left has instead decided to follow the historical and moral analysis of demagogues. There's constantly factually wrong or misleading historical information on many of these Palestinian-sympathetic accounts. An example is the map of a "disappearing Palestine" that millions have reposted, a blatantly misleading map meant to depict "Zionist colonization", meanwhile, neglecting the historical borders of the conflict. There are many other forms of historical negligence that they commonly employ that are extremely damaging for understanding the conflict.

In conclusion, Western leftists are keeping up with the Western traditions of white saviorism and interfering with this particular trendy foreign conflict. I could have written a few more grievances that I have of the Western left(including the embracement of far-right Islamist groups) but I wanted to keep the post relatively short. In several months, Western leftists will forget about the Gazans suffering under the disproportional force of the IDF. Nobody will self-criticize the ideas or tactics that they engaged in, meanwhile, the Israeli left-wing and reliable non-Hamas Palestinian advocacy organizations are left in the dust by an ineffective white-savior-esqe Western movement. Not only that but due to all of these factors making the left look like lunatics, Biden and the Democrats are being affected in the polling, which may result in Trump being elected, a terrible outcome for Palestinians.

If you want to respond to me, **please avoid strawmanning or whataboutism**. I acknowledge that the state of Israel and Jewish-"advocacy" organizations are partially responsible for worsening the grievances listed above. However, I know from posting on this sub before, that 50% of the comments are going to be either misrepresenting my stated position or trying to "hypocrisy-burn" me.

EDIT 1: I will try to respond to direct questions or direct criticisms. They are welcome.

Title: A minoriy-member just ran over 17 people on the street outside my workplace.
Content: I'm a personal trainer, 26 years old from Herzeliya.

I felt sick today so I didnt show up to work today, called it off. Had only 4 planned workout sessions with my clients so I said why not, rest is important.

Turns out that 40 minutes ago 2 palestinian workers with working permits stabbed a couple inside a car, stole the car after kicking them out bleeding on the street, and then went on to proceed and run over 17 people all across Ra'anana.

When they got to the street where my studio is located, a cvilian shot and killed them.

2 other innocent people are dead.

I dont know how to continue from here because no one would want to come training with me knowing that it happened. The feeling of security is nonexistant in these situations.

I walk around everywhere carrying 3 loaded pepper spary guns in my backpack. People still call me crazy. I dont give a shit.

Just wanted to give some of the reddit heads libro hypocrites a taste of how it's like living in israel right now as a civilian.

IDF kills cilvilians = bad occupiers, palestinians kills random people on the street = freedom fighters.

I think i'll never go on a vacation to europe again. This is insane in so many levels.

This is going to happen everywhere all across the west in the next 10-20 years. This will be the norm for everyone. I'm so sick of the west. We're nicing ourselves to death. This has to stop!

China Russia and Iran are the main beneficieries of this whole sh\*tshow. This is the reality of israel every since it was founded. It has nothing to do with anything we do or do not do. I'm so sick of everything. I feel like giving up sometimes. This world doesnt want to survive yet it somehow expects survival is the default. We are going extinct.  


Edit: 8 of the people who were ran over were school children finishing school, waiting on the bus stop. Both of the terrorists were actually caught alive.

Title: Israeli PR is terrible - a largely pro-Israel outsider's perspective
Content: As a non-Israeli, Israeli PR is terrible. There is too much focus on Israeli victimhood - this victimhood is mostly legitimate, but anti-Israel people see it as¬†**weakness and hypocrisy**. Showing burning buildings in Tel Aviv as a result of Iranian missiles gives energy to Israel's haters, who see it as revenge for the destruction of Gaza. Many people commenting on pro-Israel posts about the latest civilian casualties are under the impression that¬†**Iran is powerful and Israel is losing**. Israel should stick to sharing graphics and videos about the overwhelming success of the military operation.

Likewise, throughout the Gaza war pro-Israel pages constantly focused on October 7th. This makes sense from an Israeli perspective, but to someone who is neutral and simply tallying up the death tolls on either side, it seems ridiculous and even offensive. They should have been focusing more on the number of Hamas militants killed, and constantly sharing footage of intense fighting. They should have been reminding the public how many rockets were fired from Gaza during 'peace time', and that Hamas were the pioneers of suicide bombings and throw gay people off buildings. I have met intelligent people in everyday life who¬†**thought there was no fighting in Gaza**, and Israel were just going in and killing civilians at random. This is what it seems like to someone who sees non-stop footage of crying Gazans and all Israelis are saying is 'October 7th, October 7th'.

Title: On the new israeli plan surrounding Gaza
Content: Just this morning the Israeli government has voted in favour of enacting a new plan on how to continue the ongoing war in the gaza strip. The new plans would allow for the conquest of all of Gaza city and the displacement of the entire Gazan populace to Southern Gaza. Together with this news, the Israeli minister of finances Smotrich has also claimed that "we will conquer the Gaza strip for once and for all".

Whilst the latter statement is likely not to be taken seriously, this together with the new plan and the surrounding statements made by the cabinet on the priority of this war makes it seem like the current cabinet is taking a much more radical approach to the war, and one that seems to be in violation with international law at almost any turn. Furthermore i don't excpect this to lead to any real long term stability and to be quite honest, some of it comes over as nothing more than gaining political leverage, ill explain why:

  
First off, the current plan for diplacing the entire Gazan population to the South cannot possibly lead to anything good, mostly because it is the textbook example of ethnic cleansing. As Wikipedia states (not the best source, but on this instance it's good enough): '**Ethnic cleansing**¬†is the systematic forced removal of¬†[ethnic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic),¬†[racial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial), or¬†[religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious)¬†groups from a given area,(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous).' The plan shown by cabinet this morning describes moving all palestinians, willingly or not to the south. So calling this plan ethnic cleansing is not some kind of missplaced buzzword, it is quite literally not definable as anything else.

One of the arguments i have seen pop up on this subreddit however, is that Israel already doesn't really and shouldn't in the future abide by international, so by that logic my whole first paragraph seems kinda useless. In this case however, a breach of international law on this scale could lead to some much harsher responses globally. For exapmple, in my country there is already a lot of call to cut all ties with the Israeli government, and supposedly, the governments stance towards Israel will now be harsher, if a plan like this continues, this would possibly even lead to sanctions out of alot of EU countries. And not to even mention the response from surrounding terrorist groups. You can bet that the Houthi's will intensify their campaign, together with Iran.

  
Besides this, this plan also quite clearly shows that the current government has no plans to see any real end to the war in Gaza. This is also shown by the statement that destroying Hamas would now take priority over the rescue of all hostages. Not only does this statement kinda seem like a major middle finger to all the families of these hostages, it also means that no further peace deals will be accepted, and that the end goal of this war is now seemingly intentionally left very vague. Whilst the former is not that big of a problem for the IDF, the latter is. There have already been calls to end the war coming out of the reservist pool of the IDF and this development means that the IDF is likely going to stay for a long time, meaning longer deployment times and inevitably more casualties for the IDF. 

Lastly, the reason i think this might just be a political scheme is simply because prolonging the war appeals to the right wing parties in Nethanyanu's cabinet, wich are keeping him in power.

Edit: a quick clearup on a certain issue, the source i used claims that homogenity has to be one of the intents for ethnic cleansing to take place, this is not true however, sorry for that mistake.

Title: The reality on the ground in Israel that is ignored/denied by the pro-Palestine movement.
Content: There is something that is entirely absent from almost all discussion of this conflict and the current war. The ignorance of this reality is what makes it almost impossible to actually understand the 'cycle of violence'. It is the realiy of [Palestinian terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Terrorist_attacks_attributed_to_Palestinian_militant_groups), or 'political violence' as wikipedia calls it, against *civillians* within Israel. October 7th 2023 shocked the world in its extent, but people are unaware that the targetting of civillians within Israel proper (not in the West Bank or Gaza) is a [constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Jaffa_shooting) [occurence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Beersheba_bus_station_shooting). While people complain that Israel fails to distinguish between civillian and military targets, the Palestinian cause has never even propsed that it should make such a distinction. This is because at its root the movement considers the very existence of the state of Israel to be an injustice; not merely the occupation, or the settlements. Ignoring the obvious challenges this presents to the peace process, it creates a situation in which the Palestinians harm themselves by damaging the faith of Israeli civillians in the peace process.

  
The average Israeli has no interest in 'maintaining the occupation' or 'fighting the enemies of the Jews'. The people who think this are simply ignorant of the realities of a mandatory draft. Nobody wants to do the work. Nobody likes fighting. Nobody wants to get hurt. The 18 year olds that called up consider it slave labour. However when the average Israeli waits at a bus stop, they never know which incoming car is goung to plow through the crowd. When they get on a train they never know who is going to choose that very moment to begin their suicidal shooting spree, or try and stab them in the back. These fears are not unfounded. You can read [here](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/comprehensive-listing-of-terrorism-victims-in-israel) some of the extent to which Israeli civillians are the targets of violence. It's important to note how many of these attacks do not occur in the occupied territories. See how many take place in Tel Aviv, Israel's center of progressive, left wing, thought. These attackers are not locals defending their land, but individuals that chose to cross the border into Israel to perpetrate violent acts. It is this fear, that at any moment even the Israelis that condemn the occupation, hate Bibi, deplore the settlements, and care deeply about Palestinian rights, could be attacked in the streets, that drives the average Israeli to serve in the IDF. 

  
The occupation, therefore, represents for Israelis the potential for control of what would otherwise be their wanton slaughter. It manifests, in practice, as series of control points (borders, checkpoints) and as the constant activity of secutiry forces (IDF, Police, ISA) to thwart potential attacks. What people don't understand is that for every attack that succeeds [tens if not hundreds are thwarted](https://www.shabak.gov.il/en/reports/publications/). It's very difficult to find data on how many attacks are prevented every day, for obvious reasons, but soldiers that serve in the West Bank report constantly foiling plots to kill Israelis - proved by [finding weapons/explosives](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/world/middleeast/iran-west-bank-weapons-smuggling.html) in the houses raided. There is constant complaint and criticism about IDF raids in the West Bank, but very little consideration of why soldiers would choose to put themselves at risk by entering enemy territory, unless there was an actual strategic purpose. That purpose is the control and prevention of these violent acts of terror. [Ultimately](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Defensive_Shield#Strategic_outcome), [it](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-08-28-2024-41d98ed3cda2ba4a783913b06fbdc7d1) [is](https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-calls-for-end-to-idfs-west-bank-raid-israel-we-have-to-thwart-suicide-bombings/) [effective](https://web.archive.org/web/20110524111611/http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/html/final/sp/pa_t/det_8feb_05.htm).

  
Now in practice, I don't think that Israel can hide behind it's guns for ever. Security maintenence is not a long term solution, and only peace can bring true security. But naivety on the behalf of Israelis will bring neither peace nor security. Israelis have to contend with constant threats to their lives, and so asking them to stop the occupation is asking them to leave themselves wide open to attack. The width of Israel, at its middle, is less than 15km. This makes it incredibly easy to get to Tel Aviv from the West Bank. The border fence itself is incredibly porous, and while it is effective in reducing these attacks, it can't stop them entirely. This risk means that steps towards peace have to come from the side of the Palestinains, who have to prove that if Israel weakens its security apparatus it won't pay in dead Jews.

  
Before all the whataboutists charge in crying that Palestinins suffer greater losses, the argument is completely irrelevant. Terror attacks within Israel proper as common enough that the average Israeli feels a direct threat to their person from Palestinians on the day to day. This is the perception that underlies support for parties like Likud and continued support for occupation. Israel is a democracy, and Israelis will vote in accordance with their own interests. While security remains a priority, Israelis will vote for aggressive security measures. In this way Palestinian violence hurts Palestinians more than anybody else. It radicalizes the Israeli population. This was blatantly clear on October 7th, but began long before and has extended since. It's been said often that the war in Gaza will bring about a new generatation of terrorists, but people tend to forget the inverse of this claim: October 7th destroyed the faith of Israelis in a peaceful solution. It solidified the sense that there are people, merely kilometers in every direction, that want to kill every single Jew in the region. Israelis don't see Palestinians as fighting for their 'liberation' in the occupied territories, they see them as fighting to destroy the entire state of Israel. Under such conditions, why would they want to dismantle the occupation? It's the only thing keeping them alive.

  
If Palestinians were to constrain their 'resistance' to the West Bank (this means not shooting a single rocket from Gaza) for any reasonable amount of time Israelis could start to feel a sense of security that would allow them to withdraw. If the average Israeli could say to themselves, in good faith 'I live in Israel, not Palestine, and therefore I have nothing to fear from people trying to liberate Palestine,' it would change perspective of the entire country. Unfortunately, this is not the reality. The pro-Palestine movement does not want to create a Palestinian state next to Israe, but rather instead of Israel. Even the more moderate Palestinian leadership, Fatah, encourages violence against Israel, with their [pay-for-slay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority_Martyrs_Fund) program. This means that in practise there is no good faith movement from within Palestine to create conditions in which Israel could remove the occupation without endangering its civillians.

  
The average Israeli is well aware of this. How couldn't they be? You'd be hard pressed to find somebody who hasn't lost a friend to these attacks. But the international community is completely unaware because shootings and stabbings in Israel proper are so regular they aren't reported on, or when they are, they are done so under dishonest headlines. 

  
Even if you think all of this is propaganda, and merely one side of the dialogue, you have to realise that this is the lived reality of Israelis. If peace is actually your goal, and you believe that dismantling the occupation and creating a Palestinian state will bring about that goal, then you need to give Israelis a reason to take action towards those ends. But violence against Israeli civillians acts as a direct counter to these aims. You will never convince the Jews to allow themselves to be vulnerable by trying to murder them. Supporting Palestinian violence as 'resistance' only creates a worse situation for the Palestinians themselves. Real peace will come when the Palestinian people decide to condemn violence from within instead of [paying](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-more-cash-for-terrorists-payments-west-bank-abbas-biden-visit-martyrs-washington-11657656402) for it with [international](https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Netherlands-cuts-aid-to-Palestinian-Authority-over-terrorist-salaries-608527) aid and [celebrating it](https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinians-celebrate-jerusalem-synagogue-massacre-with-fireworks-sweets/). The problem is that violence against Israeli civillians doesn't represent resistance to the occupation, but resistance to the existance of the Israeli state. And the Jews have nowhere else to go, so they will never stop fighting to have a state. Even if you believe that the Israeli sense that they are threatened is unfounded (which seems ridiculous considering the stated aims of Hamas and the polls showing that the majority of Palestinians feel entitled to all the land, the actions by Hezbollah and Iran, and the [calls for the destruciton of the state of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calls_for_the_destruction_of_Israel)), you have to consider the very real history of the Jews: Everywhere they were forced people tried to exterminate them. So even if we pretend that the Palestinians are a uniquely moral society, in spite of the terror attacks, there is no way Israelis will accept this 'truth' without abundant proof. And violence, directed at Israeli civillians, is only proof of the contrary. This means that this 'resistance' will never bring peace.

  
Again, to all the people who will see this and immediately cry 'what about Israeli violence?!?!' All I can say is that there is [no end to criticism of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-condemned-israel-more-than-all-other-countries-combined-in-2022-monitor/), and that Israeli violence serves the purpose of protecting Israeli lives. Palestinian violence serves no other purpose than endangering Israelis. There is no argument to be made that it protects Palestinians, or that will make things better. Unless your conception of 'better' is the desruction of the Jewish state (in which case you legitimize the reverse position for Israelis, who have nowhere to go and will always choose themselves in a zero-sum situation). But such a conception is merely a repitition of the constant preference for war over peace that the Arab world has displayed for 70+ years, and is clearly not serving the Palestinians. So if you really care about the 'oppressed' you should condemn Palestinian violence and support a moderate, non-violent, path towards a two state solution. Until Israelis do not fear for their lives in the streets of Tel Aviv, Palestine will never be free.

Title: Why do some people keep insisting that the Jews in Israel are Europeans ? 
Content: It‚Äôs a difficult topic, I will ‚Äútry‚Äù to unpack it. 

1. Israel is situated in the Middle East, West Asia. I hope nobody dispute its geographical location. Egyptians are not Europeans, Jordanians are not Europeans, Lebanese are not Europeans, Syrians are not Europeans, Emiratis are not Europeans, Qataris are not Europeans, but some do consider Turkish people as Europeans and I can see why as Turkiye lies partly in Asia and partly in Europe.

2. Some of the people who keep insisting calling Jews in Israel as Europeans commented, because ‚Äúthey came from Europe‚Äù. 

Should we call all white Americans Europeans ? Is Trump a European ? Is Biden a European ? ‚Ä¶is that how it works ? So Denzel Washington is African ? Will Smith is African ? What if they had parents from different herritage / continents‚Ä¶what then ? How do you decide where ‚Äúthey came from‚Äù ? Was Steve Jobs a Middle Easterner (from his father side?) or was Steve Jobs a European ? (from his mother side?) Are none of them Americans ? Are Native Americans the only Americans ? Is that what you are trying to say ? Is Tiger Woods African (1/8), Asian (1/2), European (1/4) or Native American (1/8) ?

3. It is true some jews in Israel did fled Europe, fled from pogroms, persecution, holocaust and wars. Jews also went to America and elsewhere. You dont call those American Jews as Europeans do you ? You dont call Barbra Streisand European ? You call Barbra Streisand an American Jew or simply an American. Similarly why cant you call Israeli Jews as Middle Easterner, or simply an Israeli (not European). Why the difference ?

4. The majority of Jews in Israel today are called Mizrahi (Oriental or Eastern), they are the jews from Middle East and North Africa (Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Lebanon, etc‚Ä¶). Many of them fled to Israel or were expelled from Middle East and North Africa from violence, war and persecution. Ben Gvir, far right Israeli politician is a Mizrahi Jew, his parents were Iraqi Jew and Kurdish Jew. They are not European. 

5. There are many other Jews such as Beta Israeli, also known as Ethopian Jews. They are not European Jews either. Jews in Israel are very diverse, coming from everywhere, Europe, Russia, Middle East, Africa, Asia, India, China, South America, Caribbean, etc‚Ä¶.and many inter-marriage between different Jewish groups.

6. 80% of Jews in Israel were born in Israel. Even Netanyahu was born in Tel Aviv on 21 October 1949. They are Israeli citizens not European citizens. Why call them Europeans ?

Title: Answer for: why should Palestinians who have lived in Palestine for centuries be evicted for Jews?
Content: I will answer in the most honest but blunt way possible.

*Some of you will like my answer but some won‚Äôt.*

https://preview.redd.it/95jmvzce8aad1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba3faf95810c721934ca76486a0c41ccdc79eda2

The fact is:

***The Arabs Lost the war and wars have consequences.***

After World War II, **millions** of German Citizens were removed from German lands that were lost to expand Russia and Poland. The land of **Prussia** ceased to exist, their old Prussian capital **K√∂nigsberg** renamed by Russia to **Kaliningrad.**

The German city of **Strasbourg** was retaken by France. It did not matter that Strasbourg was for centuries a German city.

Furthermore **millions** of ethnic German speaking people who were **citizens of various Eastern European** countries and who had ancestors living in those lands for nearly **two** **thousand years** were expelled. It did not matter that they were **NEVER** citizens of Germany and had **nothing to do** with Germany‚Äôs wars of aggression, they were ethnically cleansed from across Eastern Europe.

Guilt by ethnic association.

Hundreds of thousands of **Jews** who were **citizens of Arab countries** and who were **NEVER** associated with Israel were expelled from those Arab countries after the creation of Israel.

Guilt by religious associations.

**Pontus Greek** whose ancestors had spend their lives as a community for **three** to **two thousand years** by the Black Sea and have **NEVER** been citizens of Greece were expelled to Greece or massacres by the Ottomans starting in 1913.

Guilty by linguistics association.

Poland and Russia will never return land to Germany. That‚Äôs just the reality. I know ethnic Prussian who point out how they are forgotten by history.

During the **Yugoslav Civil War** of the 1990s, many communities who had lived in various villages for hundreds if not a thousand years were displaced simply for their ethnicity or faith. Borders created, population changed. Now several of those newly independent Yugoslav nations are happy NATO members but **thousands**of Serbian families have never regained their lost properties.

Guilty by Serbian association.

Throughout the world and history the same stories are told and the same realities set in.

The US will **never** return the Spanish province of Puerto Rico to Spain (*50 year before the creation of Israel*).

That‚Äôs just the reality.

The United Kingdom had no issues removing villages to built military bases in the Chagos Islands when it fit their needs. British national security was far more important than a few local villages.

That‚Äôs just the reality.

*Western Nations have Western standard and then there is a standard that others must follow.*

***Wars have consequences.***

https://preview.redd.it/hy0phhsf8aad1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=009cc9b65a67f4298d3260d8ed8d74c489f9a7b8

**The Ottoman Empire:**

The Arabs had lost sovereignty over Israel in 1517 and for the next 400 years it was the Turkish Empire that ruled the land of Israel.

As a comparison, the Arabs lost sovereignty over Spain in 1492, just 25 before losing Israel. No one but the most fanatical argues that Spain spills return to Arab rule. This was 500 years ago.¬†

The Turkish Empire did not have a province called ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù. During the Turkish Ottoman period the Levant had a Jewish population. Jews have lived there for centuries and by the mid 19th century, Jews were the **majority** in Jerusalem.

But it did not matter that Jews were Ottoman citizens, the Ottoman Arab population still launched pogroms and massacres against the Jewish community. They did not care if Jews lived there for centuries, they attempted to force the Jews out.

The Turkish government by 1917 had owned roughly 70% of Israel. Not the Arabs, the Turkish government.

https://preview.redd.it/3wns4abh8aad1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=917a7c457a30660a7c0f008110f4bc9b7cd4441d

It was the **British Empire** who officially revived the old Roman colonial name of ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù; a homage to the colonial *Philistines*.

It was the British Empire that created the borders of the **British** **Mandate of Palestine**.

The Turkish Government owned land was transferred to Britain.

It was the British Empire who then partitioned the **British** **Mandate of Palestine** by creating the **Emirate of Transjordan**.

Thus the Jordanians were originally the ‚ÄúBritish East Bank Palestinians‚Äù as Jordan lies on the East Bank of the River Jordan.

Being an original part of British Mandate of Palestine was the reason why the **Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan** later claimed the rest of the ‚ÄúBritish Mandate of Palestine‚Äù which lead to the 1948 War.

Jordan was attempting to illegally reunify and incorporate the rest of the British Mandate of Palestine into a ‚ÄúGreater Jordan‚Äù.

https://preview.redd.it/htlo20fi8aad1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1620e839419b614c8ef2ee78c5b8b311f8ff24a9

While other Arab countries had the ambition of Pan-Arabism ÿßŸÑŸàÿ≠ÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©, the ideology of unifying all the Arab people and nations into a single Neo Arab Caliphate.

But everyone loves to talk about ‚ÄúZionism‚Äù as if all the other competing ideologies in the Middle East did not exist.

1. Palestinian Ultra-Nationalism.
2. Sunni Supremacy.
3. Shia Nationalism
4. Greater Jordan.
5. Pan-Turkism, etc.

There was no room for a Jewish, Assyrian or Kurdish state in their eyes.

**When Jordan illegally captured** and **ruled** ‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù and the ‚ÄúWest Bank‚Äù, they **did not** create an independent Palestine.

They **annexed** the territory.

They claimed legal responsibility of the Arab population by making them **Jordanian Citizenship**.

**‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù** as a concept is a *double edge sword* for the Palestinians.

The Palestinian claim ‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù for their future capital (*historically those that lose a war do not get what they want*).

But why a ‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù?

The UN Partition Plan of 1947 **NEVER** envisioned a ‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù nor the entire city as a ‚ÄúPalestinian capital‚Äù nor a ‚Äúdivided city‚Äù.

The **unified** city of Jerusalem was meant to be administered ‚Äú**Internationally**‚Äù.

The Jews accepted this plan.

The Palestinians and the rest of the Arab League had a chance for peace in 1948 but they rejected this compromise and chose war. **They lost**. Badly.

‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù was simply the portion of the city that Jordan could **only** captured and **annexed**.

Palestinians and their supporters, by accepting the concept of a ‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù (a concept **only created** through Jordanian **war** and **conquest**) are thus **legitimising** Jordan‚Äôs two decade sovereign rule of ‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù and the West Bank via conquest and consequently all its legal aspects, this includes accepting that Jordanian Citizenship was **valid** and Jordan their sovereign nation.

By accepting the concept of a ‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù (a concept **only** **created** through Jordanian **war** and **conquest**) the Palestinians are validating and accepting the concept that wars **HAVE CONSEQUENCES**.

Thus if Jordan can conquer and create a ‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù then Israel can conquer and create a ‚ÄúUnified Jerusalem‚Äù.

Jordanian ‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù thus validates Israel‚Äôs rights over the entire city of Jerusalem.

If not, then the concept of a ‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù isn‚Äôt valid and the Palestinian claim over that portion of the city isn‚Äôt valid.

Jordan intended to annex the whole of Palestine and ethnically cleansed the land of Jews.

They largely failed in their conquest. The Arabs of the West Bank who were under Jordanian control were given **Jordanian Citizenship** *except* the Jews.

The Palestinian/Jordanians ethnically cleansed the ‚ÄúWest Bank‚Äù and ‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù of Jewish families who had lived in the city for **hundreds** of years, **destroyed** all Jewish synagogues in the city and desecrated and destroyed the Jewish cemetery.

There was **no outcry** from the Arab world. That was the reality.

For nearly **two decades,** ‚ÄúWest Bank Palestinian‚Äù were **born** as Jordanian citizens. All young Palestinian today from the ‚ÄúWest Bank‚Äù have parents or grandparents who had carried Jordanian citizenship.

When Jordan granted the Palestinian citizenship, Jordan proclaimed to the international community that they took and claimed **full** legal international responsibility of that population.

Under international law **all** Palestinians in the ‚ÄúWest Bank‚Äù had a right not to be made **stateless** by Jordan regardless even if Jordan lost the ‚ÄúWest Bank‚Äù.

Jordan cannot simply void the citizenship they granted to the Palestinian of the ‚ÄúWest Bank‚Äù since there has never been an independent Palestine.

***Wars have consequences.***

Jerusalem was won by Israel in the Six Day War of 1967, it‚Äôs their capital now. How they managed it is their sovereign right.

Many nations have **eminent domain** laws. If the public good is to built school or synagogue or more public housing or any other public projects, it is Israel‚Äôs right to do so.

The Palestinian leadership has made it very clear that their independent **Palestine** will be diplomatically **ethnically cleansed** of **all Jews**.

There is **no current outcry** from the Arab world. That is the reality.

*Arab nations have an Arab standard and then there is a standard that others must follow.*

This is why they proclaim to advocate for human rights for minorities in other countries while having terrible human rights record themselves.

**Disputed Land vs Occupation:**

Like many countries today, the largest landowner is the government. During the Ottoman Empire, around 70% of the Levant was owned by the Ottoman government.

That ownership was then transferred to the British under their Mandate of Palestine (a mandate that in its charter specifically called for a Jewish homeland).

When Israel gained its independence at the end of the mandate. Israel gain ownership of the public land. Since an Arab Palestine never gained its independence (thanks to Jordanian ambition) there was no Palestinian government ownership of public land.

Again this all falls back to Jordan and was their annexation illegal or legal. It‚Äôs that double edged sword. If it was illegal then once Israel took possession of the West Bank in 1967, as the only independent successor state to the Mandate, it would have legal ownership of the West Bank.

As Jordan was the illegal occupant. Making ‚ÄúEast Jerusalem‚Äù an invalid and illegal partition.

If the Jordanian annexation was legal then it legalize the concept that wars can redefine borders and Israel is rightful in annexing the West Bank after winning the Six Day War.

https://preview.redd.it/ymf0rhvm8aad1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49d4345cd810901c50c61dec8a09fe25b7841787

**National Borders:**

Syria did **not** **recognize** the existence of Israel as a sovereign nation and did **not recognize** an actual ‚Äúnational border‚Äù with Israel. Portions of the Golan Heights fell under the 1949 Armistice Demilitarized Zone, zones that Syria prior to 67, insisted were under **no** national sovereignty.

Cease fire line are **not** national borders, without a national border that two nations mutually recognized, this open up disputes over territories and borders. Syria had originally hoped to claimed **more** territory than just the Golan Heights and have complete access to the Sea of Galilee.

Because Syria did not recognize Israel or an Israeli national sovereign border, the Golan Height and surrounding areas were *disputed territory.*

Syria could‚Äôve made peace with Israel, clearly defined each other‚Äôs sovereign national border. But Syria **did not** and **has not**, it repeatedly chose war and repeatedly lost.

For most of the 20th Century, Israel and Jordan were under that same state of war with **no recognized national borders**, what Israel took from Jordan in 1967 was simply **disputed territories**.

For land to be illegally occupied, it has to be land that was taken from another nation with **clear internationally recognized borders**.

From 1948 to 1994, Jordan did not recognize Israel‚Äôs right to exist nor any national borders. The concept of a ‚ÄúWest Bank‚Äù is thus another double edged sword.

Its size is based solely on Jordan‚Äôs war and conquest prior to 1967. There was no pre-1967 ‚ÄúWest Bank national border‚Äù, just ceased fire lines. After 1967, that ceased fire line was moved unto the Jordan River where in 1994 it officially became an internationally recognized national border between Israel and Jordan.

By insisting on a Palestinian state with the 48‚Äì67 crease fire lines, the Palestinians are once again legitimizing the ‚ÄúWest Bank conquest‚Äù made by Jordan and thus Israel‚Äôs own right to redefine that same territorial size.

***Wars have consequences.***

For those Palestinian and Arabs that demonize Israel as a ‚Äúcolonial-settler state‚Äù, (*Jews are in fact indigenous to the Levant*) they seem to have no issue with the fact that Arabs conquered and colonize North Africa.

1. They are **silent** on **Western Sahara** (*invaded and occupied by Morocco, 25 years* ***AFTER*** *the creation of Israel*).
2. They are **silent** on **Cyprus** (*northern half invaded and occupied by Turkey 26 years* ***AFTER*** *the creation of Israel*).
3. They are **silent** on the Ethic Cleansing of Armenians in **Nagorno-Karabakh** (*invaded and occupied by Azerbaijan in 2023* ).

Nor do Arab nations complain that Britain and France created the borders of every single Arab nations and gave these Arab nations dominion over other ethnic groups.

Neither Iraq, Syria, Turkey or Iran will **EVER** give up any sovereign land for an independent Kurdish homeland, no matter how many **thousands of years the Kurds may have lived on that land**.

The Arab borders were created by the victorious allies of the World Wars without regard to ‚Äúself determination‚Äù.

Borders that gave Arab nations dominion over Assyrians, Coptic, Druze, and Kurds.

That‚Äôs just the reality.

It‚Äôs been 74 years and counting since the **Arab-Israeli War** of 1948 and many governments are only now starting to understand and realize that **the war is over**.

This is a reason why Arabs nations are finally making peace with Israel. They are finally realizing that they have gained **nothing** for fighting for Palestine.

Sacrificing **their sons** for **someone else‚Äôs war** makes **no sense**.

Countries that have made peace have gained from not wasting precious financial resources on a **someone else‚Äôs no-win** war.

But the regional‚Äôs long history of state-sponsored indoctrination of hate will take a generation to phase out.

**A Time for Peace:**

**Peace** can not be achieved until one side accepts that it has lost the war.

The Japanese understood this and accepted their loss in World War II.

The Americans understood this and accepted their loss in Vietnam.

The Soviets understood this and accepted their loss in Afghanistan.

*Acceptance of loss is part of the peace process.*

Time for the Palestinian leadership to accept the reality that they lost the war and that the longer the Palestinians insist on prolonging this conflict over **disputed lands**, the **smaller** their Palestinian State will become until it is only Gaza (*the historical colonial land of the Philistines*).

***Wars have consequences.***

The war is lost, time to make **peace** and build a nation.

Title: UN Report found there is no evidence of famine in Gaza
Content: Link to the report:  
[Famine Review Committee: Review of the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) IPC-Compatible Analysis for the Northern Governorates of the Gaza Strip - Conclusions and Recommendations (May 2024)](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/famine-review-committee-review-famine-early-warning-systems-network-fews-net-ipc-compatible-analysis-northern-governorates-gaza-strip-conclusions-and-recommendations-may-2024)

Extract

>**Current** (1 ‚Äì 30 April 2024) Famine (IPC Phase 5) with reasonable evidence. The FRC does not find the FEWS NET analysis plausible given the uncertainty and lack of convergence of the supporting evidence employed in the analysis. Therefore, the FRC is unable to make a determination as to whether or not famine thresholds have been passed during April.

>**Projection** (1 May ‚Äì 31 July 2024) Famine (IPC Phase 5) with reasonable evidence As the FRC does not find the FEWS NET analysis plausible for the current period, the FRC is unable to endorse the IPC Phase 5 (Famine) classification for the projection period. However, this FEWS NET projection is in line with the FRC projection done in March 2024, which has not yet been updated.

The media reported threat of famine in Gaza has been going on for months now, with no real famine to show for it.

A previous UN report on the famine [was found](https://www.timesofisrael.com/key-gaza-famine-report-cited-by-un-icj-has-systematic-flaws-israeli-review-finds/) to have significant systematic flaws.

>According to the review, the IPC report, which covered the period from December 21, 2023, until March 10, 2024, failed to acknowledge the increase in the supply of humanitarian aid during that time; repeatedly cited unreliable and unrepresentative surveys of Gazans regarding their level of food security; and did not provide any statistics on the mortality rate from malnutrition, as would be expected to occur in a famine and as is IPC‚Äôs practice in evaluating famine.

A recent [study](https://biochem-food-nutrition.agri.huji.ac.il/arontroen/publications/nutritional-assessment-of-food-aid-delivered-to-gaza) showed that the calories going in to Gaza per day are 40% higher than what's needed.

There are also plenty of evidence of [Hamas appropriating aid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnVST02SFfc&ab_channel=TheSun) (violently), and even [laying it to waste](https://www.instagram.com/community.news/reel/C5okfdCJuXd/).

The fact that Israel is supplying so much aid (water, electricity, funding, and aid) or supporting this much aid going into to Gaza is pretty unique in modern warfare.

The closest comparison is Afghanistan, in which the amount of aid from the US was unprecedented. However it was only a trickle toward the beginning of the invasion in 2001, and took years to ramp up.

[US aid to Afghanistan - researchgate.net](https://preview.redd.it/v92dpp81l47d1.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=81eaa345f3c8dd456362d4c4e4c7667f6736a005)

**The consistent thread of lies**

My only conclusion here is that the anti-Israel propaganda is constantly testing different angles to turn the world against Israel. None of them are particularly realistic and are easily proven to be untrue:

* The claim of captured senior IDF commanders which turned out to be photos of the Nagorno-Karabakh.
* The Al Ahli hospital explosion which turned out to be a PIJ rocket.
* Viral claims that the IDF had destroyed Gaza's¬†Church of Saint Porphyrius¬†on 9 October were debunked by the church itself.
* The high toll of women and children dead which turned out to be [another lie](https://www.cfr.org/blog/un-halves-its-estimate-women-and-children-killed-gaza).
* Denial of the existence of Hamas tunnels, which Hamas themselves have even [confirmed exist](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/spider-web-hamas-tunnels-gaza-strip-raises-risks-amid-israeli-ground-offensive-3879891).
* Denial of the existence of hostages, which is a claim that ceased at the time of the first hostage deal.
* Denial of rape, which has been [confirmed by the UN](https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15621.doc.htm), and again [here](https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/un-finds-clear-convincing-information-hostages-raped-gaza-rcna141789). To me, this was a ridiculous claim especially after the footage of [Naama Levy's blood stains](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hamas-israel-palestinian-hostages-beeri-attack-rcna119337).
* Pro-Hamas accounts have misrepresented footage from the¬†Syrian civil war¬†as showing children being killed in Gaza.
* *Al Jazeera*¬†took down its video of a woman named Jamila al-Hissi who said that Israeli soldiers had "raped women, kidnapped women, executed women, and pulled dead bodies from under the rubble to unleash their dogs on them" at¬†Al-Shifa hospital in its latest siege. Former managing director of¬†*Al Jazeera*, Yasser Abu Hilalah, wrote on X, "Hamas investigations revealed that the story of the rape of women in Shifa Hospital was fabricated."

It's clear that this is the most media-driven and propaganda led conflict in human history.

According to information security experts interviewed by the New York Times, Iran, Russia, China, Iran's proxies, Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have been conducting massive online disinformation efforts focused on "\[undercutting\] Israel, while denigrating Israel's principal ally, the United States". Researchers have documented at least 40,000 bots or fake social media accounts, as well as strategic use of state-controlled media outlets like RT, Sputnik and Tasnim.

Title: Myth: Israel Population Mostly Holocaust Refugees
Content: I find the following numbers factual and persuasive evidence that helps disprove the antisemitic argument that Israel is a European-white-colonial-project mixed with a Holocaust-Survivor-pity-state. 

Post-1948, Arab countries expelled more Jews (850,000) than Israel took in Holocaust Refugees (350,000). There weren‚Äôt many to take in, you know, on account of the N-z- policy of murdering us all. 

Here is a brief overview of the numbers.

Before 1948, 650,000 Jews already lived in the land, many from migrations going back to the 1880s (the Yishuv). https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-population-of-israel-1948-present

You might ask: well, if Israel wasn‚Äôt primarily a Holocaust refugee state, how many Jews did it take in and from where and how do you account for the majority of the population?

As mentioned, only 350,000 Holocaust survivors immigrated to Israel after WWII. This is a significant number, but not the majority of Israel‚Äôs early Jewish population.
Yad Vashem: https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/remembrance/immigration.asp 

In fact, when looking at sizable Jewish migrant figures, you‚Äôll find the aforementioned fact that 850,000 Jews were expelled from or fled  Arab and Muslim countries (Iraq, Egypt, Morocco, Yemen, Syria, Libya, Lebanon, Iran) between 1948‚Äì1970 due to the formation of Israel. This is more than double the Holocaust refugees Israel took in. 

World Jewish Congress: https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/jews-from-arab-countries-and-iran
JIMENA: https://www.jimena.org/jimena-advocacy/jewish-refugees-from-arab-countries/

Between the pre-existing Israelis and the MENA region refugees, Israel was never simply a ‚ÄúEuropean colonial project.‚Äù It was the return of an ancient people (a great number of them from the Middle East) to their ancestral homeland, much of it purchased piece by piece.

What do you think about these numbers? What questions might you have about them?

Edit: this is one of several arguments that disprove the settler colonial framing and by no means the only one. For a brief summary, please see this list I wrote: [Ten Reasons Why Israel is not a Settler Colonial State](https://snailaskwhy.com/2024/11/21/10-reasons-why-israel-is-not-a-settler-colonial-state/)

Title: Stuck on Israel Palestine
Content: I've gotten to the point where I've completely lost any hope a resolution for the Israel-Palestine Conflict. Each side is so completely blinded by hate that I don't see any way for productive conversations to happen. 

On the one hand, people who are tuning into the conflict and are a bit more removed from pro-Zionist spaces or have differing influences are just seeing the numbers of the situation. 60,000 dead Palestinians at LEAST, 2,000+ dead Israelis. The so-called 'bad guy' becomes obvious then. And then you look more into it and see that its been systematic colonial oppression for 75 years, with two different races living different lives in an apartheid state. Which is true.

And the other side of it feels only fear. Fear is the most powerful motivator of all time. And when a close-knit community experiences a horror like the holocaust it sows the seeds for generations of trauma and fear and pain. When, at the end of World War 2 there was the opportunity for a Jewish state and a jewish military that would defend Jews no matter what? Of course every Jewish person wanted to be involved. To never be at the constant mercy of the government in rule. This isn't just a trauma from the holocaust its from thousands of years of history. Jewish statehood is the promise of safety, even if it may be imagined with the continued escalation by the current Israeli government and the spark of the Iran-Israel war. 

  
And then combine that with an incredibly effective propaganda machine and mandatory conscription, and then it's incredibly easy to understand that many Israeli's have been so manipulated by fear that they no longer consider Palestinians as humans, even though the Palestinians had nothing to do with the traumas of the Jewish people before the Nakba. The blame is with, most recently and relevantly, the West and Europe (and to an extent America). Safe spaces were not made in Europe and America. 

  
Anti-semitic events that experience a huge uptick globally whenever conflict occurs in Israel is a self-fulfilling prophecy. By committing an act of hatred you sow the seeds of more fear and more hatred and more bloodshed. How on earth can we have productive conversations rather than just getting lost in the panic of it all?

Idk. Open to hearing from both sides.

Title: Why is violence only "resistance" when committed by "Palestinians" or enemies of Israel?
Content: I'd rather just let the headline do the talking, but here I am, having to write a couple of words about it.

For one thing, what baffles me is the insistence on the relevance of the numbers of victims on each side. No number of victims whatsoever can say anything about where the boundaries between terrorism, resistance and warfare lie. Three thousand victims of 9/11 don't make terrorism war, while only 907 victims altogether still allow the conflict over the Falklands to be called a war.

Obviously Israel militarily is a behemoth compared to any military force directly associated with Palestine. Obviously, if one party in a conflict fights, it has to use any means at its disposal, which would be fighting guerilla-style by Hamas, using any advantage like mingling with the population and using any cover available, be it "civilian" housing or infrastructure. I don't see a reason to condemn tunnel-building as a means to try and win a war. In fact, my personal view about warfare is that fighting inefficiently is one of the most inhumane things to do when the decision to fight has already been made, and violence is already in full swing. Putting aside whether Hamas fighting this war is justified, reasonable or constructive by any means, I acknowledge the point that what is being called terrorism may be labelled as resistance - if only in parts.

Rape is non-disputably not resistance, as well as the deliberate targeting of non-combatants, or people who can't be expected to be combatants anytime soon.

If terrorism could be expected to have the effect that enemies could be forced to surrender, I would even accept that as a means of resistance, though I have the highest doubt that any such formula has any merit.

That being said, why is it generally accepted that the underdog's actions can be labelled resistance, while at the same time the perceived overpowering faction, in this case Israel, is being accused of war crimes and atrocities for actions committed in response to so-called "resistance"? How is it that only one party should claim resistance for its fight when both parties obviously struggle for their existence?

Compared to historical attempts to wipe out all Jews, and the alliance of enemies now trying to kill as many Jews as possible and wipe out Israel, namely and foremost Iran, and with it much of the Muslim world could be seen as the Behemoth, or in the biblical comparison, the Goliath.

What is so different about Israel, or the ways it fights for its existence, that the term resistance can't be applied to what the Israeli government, the IDF and the Mossad do?

Title: Don't worry Israel does not care and this is Iran's year!
Content: Until trump gets elected iran is going to be as strong as it is currently. They may get a bit more but not much. Meanwhile they will loose gaza and Hezbollah militants and infrastructure. No matter what downs they face this the first year of the war is their best year. it all goes down hill from here. give trump a month and iran will be pleading with israel.

All the fuss. All the sacrifice from these people will be for noting. they are the offenders so if they fail they lost. israel will suffer losses but its people will survive and after a war their is always a baby boom. Gaza will be allot harder to rebuilt and the infrastructure not just physically but the terrorist ideology will be crumbled. once that happens peace will return to the middle east by force. the night is darkest just before the dawn.

Putin is not a threat after trump is elected. why do you think their doing this now they wouldn't've dare do it back when trump was in office. Compared to the us Russia got nothing their nukes are dudes compared to the us. and israel going to be very heavily armed after this. You think they'll sit on their thumbs after this atrocity. this will strengthen the idea, the truth that israel is needed in the middle east. there will be much more funding and far far more arms to strengthen israel. that woke peace crap is over their going to be 10x more armed with missiles and other arms.

Iran funds Hezbollah and Hamas. Russia funds and houses em too;thats the main core of their strength and its going to crumble. Putin will submit to trump as he always did. Iran will be against both israel which its struggling with now plus a much more fierce us. Putin loves the left because they make countries weaker. 

Like the late great Benjamin Graham said don't pay attention to sudden spikes in stock only long term patterns. Gaza not nearly as backed up as israel and they have allot of building too do;so after this war israel will have the tools to prevent oct 7. And those saying gaza has a right to defend themselves ;I argue by saying not when there always the ones attacking. you want independence stop being terrorists. hopefully this will be a chance to force them to make peace and rebuild a better governments.

Title: "Double standards"
Content: People often ask: 

Why is it okay for Israel to have nuclear weapons, but not Iran? 

Why do you care if Iran is failing to comply with the non-proliferation treaty when Israel has undeclared nuclear weapons?

Yes, I am "excusing" the fact Israel has undeclared nuclear weapons. Yes, I am still concerned about the fact Iran is developing a nuclear weapon.

Israel has nucelar weapons for deterrence. These are not actively being used against other countries and they have not threatened to use them.

Israel is an ally of the United States and has not threatened to wipe another country and more specifically my country off the map.

Iran, on the other hand, is a theocratic Islamic regime that funds terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East, chants "death to America", and has killed American soldiers.

We should not treat Iran and Israel the same. The idea there is a double standard meaning "the application of different sets of principles for situations that are, in principle, the same" does not actually make sense in this case. Israel and Iran are not the same. The intentions each country has matters, the leadership of each country matters, and the trust we've built up with these countries matters.

I'm aware there are other countries that are hostile towards the United Sates that are nuclear yet have not used them. However, I don't think that means we should allow more hostile countries to become nuclear. The less nukes the better, we are where we are though and it's clear current nuclear capable countries aren't going to dismantle their arsenals.

This argument that it's "unfair" is super naive and makes me feel as if I'm speaking to a child. Of course it's unfair, the world is unfair, get used to it. Come up with a better argument for why I as an American should be okay with Iran having nukes if Israel or the United States has the capabilities to prevent this from happening.

Title: I have a question for all those who hate Israel and call it a "terrorist state committing a genocide"
Content: Are ya'll blind? Where on earth are you seeing a genocide in Gaza? You all be calling civilian casualties "targeted attack" and attempts of genocide, but do you all ignore and forget the capacity of Israel's army? They have NUKES for God's sake. If they were committing a genocide, there would've been no Gaza since October 8. SO many more would've been dead. But that is literally not what is happening.
That's war. Sadly, there are always casualties. So get over your brainwashed propaganda and actually understand what is happening.
ISRAEL ARE NOT TARGETING CIVILIANS. THEY ARE TARGETING TERRORISTS.
Even look at the attack they carried out in Iran yesterday. Did you see them shoot at civilians? Aiming for their homes? Like Iran did with their attack on Israel back a month ago?
Like literally Iran be out there and PROUDLY say they are looking to destroy Israel. THEIR GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT WITH NO SHAME.
And ya'll be calling Israel the terrorist genociders???? Hello????
Israel has nukes. Never have they once used. And neither are they planning to.
Yet Iran are building nukes, to send then to Israel to kill them all!!! The moments they have their nukes, be sure they won't hesitate before firing it to Israel. THAT IS FREAKING GENOCIDE.
And ya'll are even more stupid to believe that they will stop with Israel. They're after the US too. And the rest of the world after. Their plan is to take over the world with Islam, and more specifically RADICAL ISLAM. Literally most of the Iranians oppose the government and support Israel. So how blind can you be?
I really hope the world wakes tf up and stop Iran before it's too late. Or they will literally destroy the world.

Sorry it was long but I just had to get this out. What do you all think?

How can you speak about the conflict while ignoring the party that has armed, trained, and funded the terror proxies ‚Äî Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis ‚Äî who have been bombing Israel thousands of times?

Why don‚Äôt you mention the Houthis in Yemen who have spent millions of dollars firing missiles at Israel, instead of feeding my starving people?

I ask the UN, the Arab League, and everyone who has been raising the Palestinian flag since October 7: Where is the flag of Yemen?

In my country, half a million people have died in the last 10 years. The biggest famine and humanitarian crisis in modern history. Why does no one care when half a million Yemenis die?

What about Sudan? In less than two years, more than 150,000 people have been killed. Where is the flag of Sudan?

What about Syria? Half a million Syrian have been killed. Where is the Syrian flag?

High Commissioner, why is it that when Arabs kill millions of Arabs, no one bats an eye? Where is the outrage, and where are the protests?

And why is Qatar sitting here as a member of this Human Rights Council when they host the Hamas terror chiefs in luxury hotels?‚Äù

Title: Message From a Gazan to Campus Protesters: You're Hurting the Palestinian Cause
Content: An interesting opinion piece that appeared a couple of days ago in Newsweek. The piece, written by a Palestinian from Gaza and peace activist, Hamza Howidy, talks about the hypocrisy of the protestors across the US‚Äôs college campuses, and how misinformed many of them are. It is eye-opening, and in line also with what many Iranian friends of mine feel about the ‚Äúnew-found love‚Äù foreigners in the US and Europe have for the Nez√¢m (aka the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran), and apparently what many Yemenites feel about the support the Houthis get, and Lebanese about supporting the Hezbollah. 

It appears that the vast majority of those protestors have little-to-no knowledge about what ‚Äúlife on the ground‚Äù is in those places, and protest to virtue-signal or perhaps to have a sense of belonging to a cause. Personally, as a gay man who lived in the region for over a decade, I am especially dumbfounded by ‚ÄúQueers for Palestine.‚Äù I truly don‚Äôt think many of them realize that they would most likely be dead in a flash in Palestine ‚Äì supportive of the Palestinian cause or not. 

For disclosure, although I lived in Israel for a while, and pro-Israel, I am not a big fan of Netanyahu and his government and happy to criticize many of their actions. I am also a strong believer in a two-state solution, but aware that in order for this to happen there must be good faith from both sides ‚Äì without it, there cannot be peace.  If you are pro-Palestinians, pro-human rights and peace, listen to the people you try to advocate for:
